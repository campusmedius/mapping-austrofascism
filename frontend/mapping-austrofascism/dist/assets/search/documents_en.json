By researching what had happened in Vienna on May 13 and 14, 1933, I soon understood why Kraus had experienced this weekend as a turning point. Consequently, I decided to represent fifteen selected events within twenty-four hours, from Saturday at 2 p.m. to Sunday at 2 p.m., on a digitized map of Vienna from 1933. Supervised by the media scholar Shannon Mattern, the initial version of the website was developed in collaboration with the software engineers Rory Solomon and Darius Daftary and the designer Mallory Brennan at The New School in New York and launched at campusmedius.net in July 2014. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:4","text":"The selection of the empirical material was also influenced by the concept of the chronotope. In the 1930s, Mikhail Bakhtin had written an essay on time-spaces or space-times in literature from antiquity to the Renaissance, which became very important in literary studies after its publication in 1975.  His approach inspired me to limit the historical case study to exactly twenty-four hours in Vienna—a temporal and spatial unity that not only emerged in the course of events, but also resembles the most significant chronotope of the Modernist novel. Just think of James Joyce's Ulysses, Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, Andrei Bely's Petersburg, or—to name another medium—the documentary Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis by Walter Ruttmann. In all these artworks from the first third of the twentieth century, one finds the attempt to capture modernity in a very specific time-space: a day in the city. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:5","text":"The historical chronotope of twenty-four hours in Vienna on May 13 and 14, 1933, is marked by so-called \"Turks Deliverance Celebrations\" (Türkenbefreiungsfeiern) held by the Austrian Homeland Protection (Heimatschutz) in the gardens of Schönbrunn Palace and by the NSDAP in the Engelmann Arena. As the 250th anniversary of the city's liberation from the Ottoman siege in mid-September 1683, celebrated in advance for reasons of propaganda, these competing rallies were oriented from the outset on media communication: prepared by the party-political press, partially broadcast live on Radio Wien, and captured in newsreels. To create counter-publicity, the Social Democrats published programmatic editorials and organized \"freedom celebrations\" in the municipal housing projects (Gemeindebauten). While the Burgtheater staged the play Hundred Days, co-written by Benito Mussolini, several cinemas were screening Fritz Lang's sound feature The Testament of Dr. Mabuse, a film banned in Germany. In other movie theaters, adherents of National Socialism viewed the documentary Germany Awakes, and a group of communists showed Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and Turksib by Viktor Turin. Moreover, the Sunday edition of the Neue Freie Presse, Vienna's most important bourgeois newspaper, printed an essay entitled \"Humbug, Bluff, and Ballyhoo\" on public relations as practiced by Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud."},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:6","text":"Users can discover what was happening simultaneously at different places in Vienna by moving the twenty-four-hour timeline.  The interactive map also makes it possible to give a spatial overview of the events. Inspired by the research platform HyperCities, to which Campus Medius in general owes a lot, we not only geo-referenced their sites but used an established technique for historical mapping projects known as rectification. In our case, a city map of Vienna from 1933 was scanned with high resolution at the Austrian National Library, converted into a GeoTIFF file, and rectified to align with the underlying GIS data of OpenStreetMap.  This technological procedure discomfited me because of the idea that a digital map represents reality from which a printed map more or less deviates. What actually happens in the process of rectification, though, is a translation between different projections of reality that ought to be traced back to the historical conditions of their emergence.  Due to this critique of the cartographical approach, we have striven to question and alienate these standardized representations of time and space in the current version of the project that I will discuss in the second chapter."},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:7","text":"By selecting a pin on the map, an actor-network of the respective event popped up in the initial release of campusmedius.net.  Methodologically, this visualization was derived from actor-network theory, which basically states that it is not a subjective consciousness that decides to act, and then things happen accordingly—in other words, that actions should not be understood as human intentions, but rather as interplays between human and nonhuman actors.  We styled the actor icons along the lines of the International System of Typographic Picture Education (ISOTYPE), a conceptually universal picture language developed under the direction of the political economist and Austro-Marxist Otto Neurath, a member of the Vienna Circle, from the mid-1920s onwards.  In our project, however, ISOTYPE is not regarded as a universal design concept, but rather as a visual vocabulary that is closely related to the historical setting of the case study. In Campus Medius 1.0, the colors of the icons designated political backgrounds, with red for socialist and communist, green for Austrofascist, brown for National Socialist, and blue for bourgeois actors. If the user clicked on this actor-network window, a multimedia description of the associated event opened up, featuring photographs, sound recordings, movie clips, archival documents, press articles, etc. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:8","text":"This is, by and large, the first version of campusmedius.net as the website went online in 2014—a kind of digital exhibition.

By October 29, 2020, the Austrian National Library, for example, had made twenty-three million newspaper pages available in Austrian Newspapers Online (ANNO): What is such \"big data\" good for if it is not correlated in meaningful ways? One way is to develop algorithms that help recognize patterns; another way is to curate this cultural heritage in digital monographs. We started with the latter approach, used the preliminary results to translate our theoretical concepts into a data model, and have begun to devise an algorithmic analysis based on the second version of the project that I will present in the following chapter."},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:10","text":"In the current version of campusmedius.net published in April 2021, which was programmed by Andreas Krimbacher and designed by Susanne Kiesenhofer, the aforementioned overview of the historical chronotope continues to exist in the \"Topography\" module, comprising as before the twenty-four-hour timeline and the rectified map of Vienna from 1933.

The narrative technique of telling a story from different perspectives is very common in novels, films, and TV serials.

Or more precisely, what does it mean to have a media experience in modernity? This line of inquiry derives from Michel Foucault's studies of criminality or sexuality as modern possibilities of experiencing.  But can we also conceptualize mediality as an experiential field in the Foucauldian sense? What possibilities of having media experiences have opened up in the modern age since about the mid-seventeenth century? The table answers this question with a bold thesis: having a media experience in modern societies essentially means using reason in sovereign signs, capturing life in examining gazes, or speaking up in governed transmissions. These three possibilities of having media experiences—in Foucauldian terms: dispositifs of mediation—materialize in heterogeneous mediators. For our case study on the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration,\" each mediation is expressed by five selected mediators whose icons are designed along the lines of ISOTYPE  and that are associated in specific types of connection, in distinct topologies. Are the mediators building territories or spreading in an unlimited space? Do they end sometime or potentially exist infinitely? Is a centralized or an equalized distribution taking place? Etc. The mapping interfaces result from these dispositifs of mediation, because seeing things from a bird's-eye perspective, panoramically, or in street view entails certain notions of the world, certain ideologies that we aim to elucidate. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:12","text":"So how was the new Topology module implemented on the website? I start with the mediation \"How to Use Reason: Sovereign Signs,\" taking the example of the mediator Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the federal leader of the Austrian Homeland Protection and initiator of the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" in Vienna on May 14, 1933.  Instead of a timeline, the Topology includes a selector beneath the map where the users can switch between the three mediations. In this case, the mediators are viewed from above and navigated via zooming. The network is centralized, that is, all navigations have to pass a central node: the transcendent bird's-eye view, overarching the earth's surface, which is not only the perspective of god, but also of the sovereign monarch overseeing his or her territory. This world view was very familiar to Starhemberg, who came from an old aristocratic family of the Habsburg Monarchy, which ended together with World War I in 1918.  One of his ancestors was Count Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg, the successful military commander of Vienna during the Ottoman siege of the city in summer 1683. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:13","text":"Led by Federal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrian government adopted an authoritarian course in March 1933.

The protest corresponds to the findings of a contemporary study carried out by the Wirtschaftspsychologische Forschungsstelle, based in Vienna and headed by Paul Lazarsfeld, who later became a major figure in American sociology after his emigration to New York.  The RAVAG had commissioned this Center of Economic-Psychological Research to run a statistical survey of the tastes of Austrian radio listeners.  The innovative aspect of the RAVAG study, conducted in 1931/32, was not only the quantitative measurement of listeners' wishes, but above all the fact that it provided information on the likes and dislikes of various social groups. By correlating radio programs with social data, the final report broke down the mass audience into specific target groups.

On the other side of the software stack, however, its back end is located; invisible to the users, it is a database in which all the content is stored. What I would like to stress here is that deciding which entities are included in the database and how they are related is a genuinely methodological matter. In order to build a scholarly website, the research approach needs to be operationalized; at least working definitions of the central concepts are necessary. In a project within the field of cultural and media studies, this work definitely cannot be conducted by software engineers alone, because: \"The database is the theory!\"  If a website is supposed to match up to the complexities of the theoretical approaches that are guiding cultural and media research, both its back end and its front end must be developed in a truly interdisciplinary dialogue with programmers and designers. Hence, the following paragraphs will deal with the data model on which the Topology module of Campus Medius is based. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:20","text":"I start with the entity at the top of the diagram, the mediator as anyone or anything given in an experience that makes a difference in the course of action. In our terminology, a medium is none other than a type of mediators: Starhemberg appears on the stage of the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" as federal leader of the Austrian Homeland Protection, but ideally aligns himself with leader figures ranging from the Roman Caesars via the Habsburg emperors to the Fascist Duce. This is an example of a one-to-many relationship, with one medium constituted from many mediators. It was important for us to attach the attributes space, time, and value—the latter understood in terms of weighing the nodes in a network—to the relation, which connects two mediators, and not to the mediator itself.  The common practice in digital cartography, however, is to determine where and when an entity occurs, i.e., to set its location (latitude/longitude) and its date and time. Yet this approach would have required a kind of transcendent gaze, an external perspective able to situate mediators in absolute time and space. In order to avoid this \"god trick of seeing everything from nowhere,\"  we have conceptualized space, time, and value relationally, in other words as differences in the network of mediators. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:21","text":"An experience, in the sense of our data model, is an individual subset of relations including the attached mediators. And just as in our terminology a medium is a type of mediators, a mediation is a pattern of relations (e.g., the centralized topology occurring again and again in the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\"). In other words, a regularity of spatial, temporal, and evaluative connections—but what is actually mediated in an experience? This question links to the box at the foot of the data model, which summarizes the major function of the Foucauldian dispositif, namely to strategically respond to a social demand.  While actor-network accounts focus on concrete empirical cases in order to precisely describe who or what makes a difference to a course of action, dispositif analysis searches for types of connection, for historical patterns of relations that are actualized in the given situation. Let us take the aforementioned example of the protest against the live broadcast of the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\": the people who canceled their license wanted to speak up and refused to be influenced or educated from above—a collective demand to which Austrian radio was not ready to respond in 1933. However, counseled by the emigrants Paul Lazarsfeld, his wife Herta Herzog, and his friend Hans Zeisel, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and the New York advertising agency McCann-Erickson soon learned how to steer free expression of opinion in specific directions. "},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:22","text":"In short, the actor-network and the dispositif are the central theoretical concepts that are operationalized in the data model of Campus Medius 2.0.  Thus far, I have only elaborated on the right-hand part of the diagram, the ontological structure of the database.

We want to develop the website into a digital platform for mapping media experiences. Guided by a virtual assistant, the users may independently select a media experience in their daily lives, precisely describe its heterogeneous components, and map how these mediators are connected with each other. The analytical aim of the platform would be to subject the conceptual premises of the historical case study to a contemporary test: does having a media experience in the (post)modern societies of the twenty-first century still mean using reason in sovereign signs, capturing life in examining gazes, or speaking up in governed transmissions? In the case of the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration,\" these dispositifs of mediation arose from an interplay between the empirical material and a Foucauldian theory of modernity.  I want to highlight the word interplay in the sense of a mutual dialogue here, because no data explain themselves, but it also leads nowhere to obey a theoretical system that degrades them to mere placeholders. However, we are confident that our data model enables us to define media and mediations immanently, so to say from below, by analyzing numerous mappings of media experiences in order to discover types of mediators and relational patterns that are distinctive of mediality as a (post)modern field of experience."},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:26","text":"The idea for this collaborative platform evolved from courses on \"Mapping Modern Media,\" which I have taught at different universities since 2016.

How are these mediators connected with each other? To which demand is the media experience responding? And what might an alternative response be?

I encourage the students to explore the connections in terms of space, time, and value, but it is not strictly necessary for all three perspectives to be represented. Steps four and five are intended to be a critique of the analyzed situation: after contemplating to which urgent demand the media experience is responding, identifying its leitmotif, an alternative response or answer should be given in the form of a counter-map.  One student of mine chose to look into her habit of watching Tatort, for example, a very popular crime series produced and aired by public service broadcasters in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. She asked herself why she views this TV drama almost every Sunday evening and concluded that she mainly appreciates the sense of community, knowing that millions of other viewers see and hear the same program at the same time. Yet if the \"sense of community\" is the real motive behind this media experience, what alternatives are there to feel in touch with others? Does it have to be a community of people with a similar language and cultural background (as in the case of Tatort)? Or could it also be a collective assembling more diverse members?"},{"type":"page","title":"Overview","location":"/overview?lang=en#p:28","text":"In conclusion, I will present some sketches, maps, and diagrams created in these mapping courses.

It published a journal, held lectures and exhibitions, and in 1931 organized an excursion to the \"workers' paradise\" in the East.  One of the group's main advertising media was Russian films, which were screened in various small movie theaters.

The Potemkin, however, evades the approaching squadron as the ships lower their guns to let the escaping comrades pass.  In the film's most famous sequence, in which the citizens of Odessa flee from the shooting soldiers on the harbor steps, close-ups of rows of stamping boots are intercut with pictures of a desperate mother holding her shot child in her arms, rifle barrels are contrasted with horrified faces in shorter and shorter cuts, until a baby in a buggy rolls down the steps.  The scene is intended to create pathos, to put the audience into an ecstatic state. "},{"type":"event","title":"Friedensbrücken Kino","location":"/topography/events/8?lang=en&info=full#p:4","text":"According to Eisenstein's understanding, the physical, emotional, and intellectual effects of film merge. The montage of camera shots prompts motor movements: the spectator flinches, pulls a face, covers their eyes. The rising abhorrence and the conclusion that justice must be done are also, in Eisenstein's view, (brain-based) physiological reactions to sensory stimuli.  Whether the director succeeds in creating this effect is a question of artistic skill. In the case of Battleship Potemkin, professional opinion has always been undivided, even that of Joseph Goebbels: \"It is wonderfully made, it signifies filmic art without parallel,\" the National Socialist propaganda minister said in a speech to German filmmakers in Berlin on May 28, 1933. "},{"type":"event","title":"Friedensbrücken Kino","location":"/topography/events/8?lang=en&info=full#p:5","text":"Turksib was also a major success around 1930, although film scholars do not regard it as a masterpiece.  Viktor Turin, who had studied in the USA, made the documentary about the Soviet construction project, the Turkestan-Siberian railway, in the style of a drama. He used a screenplay by Viktor Shklovsky, employed workers as actors, and outstretched the budget of the small Vostok Kino studio. When the film was released in 1929, critics and audiences were hugely impressed—not only in Russia, but in the rest of Europe as well.   Turksib presents the building of the railway line as a battle against nature by man and machines.  Once the engineers have surveyed the land and planned the line, civilization in the form of the steam-driven steel machine breaks through deserts and ice to transport grain to the south and cotton to the north of the Soviet Union."},{"type":"event","title":"Friedensbrücken Kino","location":"/topography/events/8?lang=en&info=full#p:6","text":"Turin's Orientalist view of the Asian parts of the state is clear in a sequence staging a race between nomads and a locomotive.  Kazakh riders chase after the train on horses, bulls, and camels, but they seem ridiculous with their animals in contrast to the fast-moving engine, its iron wheels and pillars of smoke appearing huge on the screen. Hence, Turksib does not show a class conflict, but an ethnic gap between progressive Europeans and backward Asians—a message that may well have helped the film to its international success.  In Vienna on May 13 and 14, 1933, at least, this dichotomy was something the hostile parties could agree on, be it in a communist movie theater or at the \"Turks Deliverance Celebrations\" (Türkenbefreiungsfeiern) held on Saturday in the Engelmann Arena and on Sunday in the gardens of Schönbrunn Palace."},{"type":"title","title":"Neue Freie Presse","location":"/topography/events/9?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"Neue Freie Presse"},{"type":"keywords","title":"Neue Freie Presse","location":"/topography/events/9?lang=en&info=full","text":"Neue Freie Presse Vienna 1933 propaganda Arthur Rundt advertising Sigmund Freud New York USA Edward Bernays marketing public relations P.T.

Bernays […].\"  Before the piece appeared in Vienna's most important bourgeois newspaper, located at Fichtegasse 11, it had come out in the April issue of the Berlin journal Der Querschnitt.  It was based on an article on \"The Science of Ballyhoo,\" which John T. Flynn had published a year previously in Atlantic Monthly.  For both writers, Barnum's great bluffs were a thing of the nineteenth century; contemporary America, however, was under the thrall of scientific public relations as practiced by Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud."},{"type":"event","title":"Neue Freie Presse","location":"/topography/events/9?lang=en&info=full#p:3","text":"Barnum's career as a showman began in 1835, when he bought an old, blind slave and claimed she was Joice Heth, George Washington's wet nurse. In actual fact, the woman was not 161 years old but only half that age, as was established after her death. \"Humbug, bluff, and ballyhoo\" was also staged for the American Museum in New York, which Barnum took over in 1841.  The article in the Neue Freie Presse mentions, for instance, \"General Tom Thumb\": Barnum taught a five-year-old little person to impersonate historical figures such as Hercules and Napoleon and presented the boy's performances in his cabinet of curiosities.  As the show proved very successful, the two of them toured Europe, where General Thumb even performed before the queen of England and the Russian tsar.

Starhemberg allegedly advised Dollfuss that it was precisely at this point that one had to develop \"an Austrian strength\" that would give the people security and confidence.  Whereas the federal chancellor was planning on holding a Christian Social Party conference as a large patriotic event, Starhemberg advocated a rally of the Austrian Homeland Protection (Heimatschutz), the paramilitary organization that he had overseen as its federal leader since 1930. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/1?lang=en&info=full#p:4","text":"To secure financing for this mass rally, Starhemberg traveled to Rome to Benito Mussolini, whom he knew personally.  According to his memoirs, he described to the Italian prime minister the plan for \"a systematic wave of propaganda for Austria and against National Socialism.\"  Due to their shared language, \"the Greater German feeling\" was very pronounced in Austria, but precisely therein lay the critical issue: \"We must finally muster the courage,\" said Starhemberg, \"to juxtapose the idea of a Greater Germany with an entirely unrelated idea of Austria.\"  Allegedly, Mussolini emphatically welcomed this suggestion and named the concept of italianità in Fascist Italy as a model: \"You must create something like that in Austria.\"  Having already supplied weapons to the Austrian Home Guards (Heimwehren) at the beginning of the year, Mussolini now also provided the money for Starhemberg's propagandist event. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/1?lang=en&info=full#p:5","text":"Although in the memoirs he wrote in exile, Starhemberg stresses that the rally was in opposition to National Socialism, he makes no secret of the fact that the event was also intended to seal the \"abolition of degenerate democracy.\"  In his view Austria was not mature enough for a democratic system of government in 1918, when the Habsburg Monarchy collapsed with the end of World War I. Allegedly, hardly anyone had believed in the survival chances of the small republic that was left of the empire.  The political parties had not been concerned about the country and its people, he continues, but rather about their own interests, which they had proclaimed at the top of their voices on the streets of Vienna and on the front pages of the newspapers: \"The result was a parliamentarianism that became the stomping ground of rampant party demagoguery and wild battles for party-political gains at the cost of the population as a whole.\"  When in March 1933 Dollfuss used a parliamentary crisis regarding the rules of procedure to start governing as a dictator using emergency decrees, he had simply \"put an end to a circumstance that had become untenable.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/1?lang=en&info=full#p:6","text":"According to Starhemberg, therefore, a twofold sign was required in spring 1933: for Austria as an independent state with an authoritarian government and against Austria's enemies, whether that be National Socialism, which wanted to absorb the country in a Greater German Reich, or Social Democracy, which was committed to establishing an international \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\"  This sovereign sign would be made in the form of a mass rally by the Austrian Homeland Protection League (Heimatschutzverband), which Starhemberg staged as a \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" (Türkenbefreiungsfeier).  In 1933 Vienna's liberation from the second Ottoman siege lay 250 years in the past. The state anniversary celebrations, however, only took place in late summer, in view of the fact that it was the famous Battle of Vienna on September 12, 1683, that had brought the roughly two-month siege to an end.  Why did Starhemberg call his event in May a \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" contrary to historical fact? He does not explain his choice in his memoirs, but it can be assumed that his family history provides the reasons. Had the Habsburg Monarchy and with it the Austrian nobility survived World War I, then when his father Ernst Rüdiger died in 1927, the Starhemberg rank of prince would have gone to him, the Imperial Count von Starhemberg, who was born Ernst Rüdiger Camillo Maria on May 10, 1899, at Eferding Palace in Upper Austria."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/1?lang=en&info=full#p:7","text":"The Starhemberg family was one of the oldest aristocratic dynasties in the Habsburg Monarchy.  Its progenitor is believed to be a Gundacker from the twelfth century whose grandson of the same name built Starhemberg (Storichenberch) Castle on the Hausruck hills in Upper Austria from which the family later derived its surname. A crucial role in the family's history was played by Erasmus I (1503–1560), who married Anna von Schaunberg, meaning that the majority of the rich Schaunberg inheritance went to the House of Starhemberg. With his sons Rüdiger, Gundaker, and Heinrich, Erasmus founded the three main branches of the family, of which the Rüdiger lineage survives to the present day.

His grandson of the same name was childless, meaning that his property and princeship passed to a distant cousin, namely Camillo Rüdiger von Starhemberg. Yet in 1927 his great-grandson Ernst Rüdiger, who fought on the Italian front in World War I and participated in the National Socialist putsch in Munich in 1923, only inherited the extensive family property: the parliament of the newly founded Republic of German-Austria had passed a law abolishing the nobility in 1919. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/1?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"The so-called Law on the Abolition of the Nobility (Adelsaufhebungsgesetz), which still applies in Austria, prohibits the use of not only noble titles, but also noble coats of arms.

This is the heraldic animal of the Styrian dukes whom Gundacker I, the Starhemberg progenitor, served as a knight. However, the heraldic panther, which remains a feature of the Styrian provincial coat of arms to this day, does not depict a black leopard, but rather a fire-breathing chimera formed from parts of various animals.

The last alteration to the coat of arms was made in 1765 to commemorate the conferral of the princeship to Georg Adam von Starhemberg. On this occasion, the panther, which now holds the Turkish head in its left and the sword in its right paw, is turned to face the opposite direction on the inescutcheon. In addition, the spire of St. Stephen's Cathedral no longer towers over the entire coat of arms but rather is located in the left (heraldic right) upper field behind a depiction of the bastion of Vienna, i.e., the city's fortifications constructed since the sixteenth century.

Considering this heroic history, it was the duty of the Homeland Protection \"to preserve the liberty and independence of our beautiful Austria, hallowed as it is by the death of thousands.\" Since 1918, however, \"party politics\" and \"class warfare\" had demoralized the Austrian people, who needed a savior, demanded a savior. \"Be that savior,\" said Starhemberg to Federal Chancellor Dollfuss, \"and be confident that everything supports you and everything is with you when you set about saving Austria.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/1?lang=en&info=full#p:17","text":"Dollfuss also commemorated the historical events of 1683, yet he emphasized not only Count von Starhemberg but also the then barely twenty-year-old Prince Eugene of Savoy, who fought bravely in the Battle of Vienna and subsequently \"warded off the danger of the Asian incursion into Western Christian civilization for all time.\"  However, after the World War, in which Dollfuss had himself performed his duty as a soldier at the front, the enemy had infiltrated the Austrian population via \"foreign ideas.\" He wanted to fight these socialist ideologies and build a \"Christian German state under the rule of law\" whose population would be grouped according to profession.

As Hans Frank had \"deeply insulted the Austrian government and given notice of a violent intervention by Bavaria against Austria in a speech on the radio,\" the authorities would need to clarify \"whether he can even be permitted to stay on Austrian soil as a private citizen.\" According to the article, it was beyond question that the announced party politicians had to strictly abide by Austrian laws in the event of their arrival. The text closes by asking whether the German Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler, who had demonstrated \"a high degree of discretion and moderation\" in international politics, agreed with this \"journey of party-political agitation by high-ranking state officials.\" In any event, the necessary measures would in no way be targeted at the government of the German Reich, \"but exclusively at the attempt by foreign guests to give new stimulus to subversive and antigovernmental agitation within our own borders.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:5","text":"In clear and strict terms, the leading article opposed a violation of Austrian state sovereignty.

While the Social Democratic Workers' Party believed Austria should join the Weimar Republic, the NSDAP pushed for an authoritarian Greater German Reich. As such, it was primarily the Christian Social Party and the Autrofascist Homeland Protection League that wanted to preserve Austria as an independent state. The \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" planned for May 14, 1933, in the Schönbrunn Palace gardens was intended to make a stand for a sovereign Austria under the leadership of the Christian Social Federal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, who had been governing by emergency decree since March of that year."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:6","text":"But now the NSDAP's Viennese press office had declared that National Socialist politicians from Germany—where Hitler had been Reich chancellor since late January 1933—would visit that same weekend.

As the leading article emphasizes, it was therefore not an official state visit. However, it was also not accurate to describe their stay in Austria as private, especially given the existence of this official party communiqué.

Even its subtitle, namely \"Independent Daily Newspaper for the Christian People\" (Unabhängiges Tagblatt für das christliche Volk) does not help explain this defensive role, instead raising the additional question why the Neue Freie Presse and the Arbeiter-Zeitung referred in their commentaries on the leading article to the \"main organ of the Christian Social Party\" and the \"government organ.\" However, both matters are explained by the history of the newspaper, whose founding dated back to a resolution by the Linz Catholic Convention of 1892 to publish a modern Christian newspaper for the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.  After some trial issues and flyers in the course of 1893, the Reichspost was published daily from January 1, 1894.  Friedrich Funder, the editor in chief and editor of the newspaper for many years, explained in his memoirs how its programmatic title should be interpreted:"},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"The paper saw its responsibility as extending to the empire and all its nations.

The \"Reich\" of the newspaper's title was not a nation, not a homogeneous people, but rather an expansive territory in Central Europe whose heterogeneous components were kept together by the emperor, the sovereign. The reference in the subtitle that it was a \"daily newspaper for the Christian people\" meant that the Reichspost was in opposition to the liberal, in its opinion \"Jewish,\" press on the one hand and to the Social Democratic newspapers on the other. In contrast to the Arbeiter-Zeitung, the main organ of Austrian Social Democracy since 1889, the Reichspost claimed to be independent. In point of fact, however, it had always functioned as a mouthpiece for the Christian Social movement, which had been constituted as a political party in 1893 under the future Mayor of Vienna Karl Lueger. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:18","text":"Above all it was Funder's personal connections that linked the paper ever closer to the Christian Social Party. Born in Graz in 1872, he arrived at the Reichspost as a law student in 1896, soon carved out a career for himself in its small editorial team in Vienna, and was appointed editor in chief in 1902 and two years later its editor, too. Following Lueger, Funder openly advocated a \"Christian antisemitism\" in numerous leading articles denouncing cultural and economic influences from Judaism, but expressly dissociating the paper from the racial antisemitism of the \"Pan-Germanists\" (and later of the National Socialists).  As Funder was one of Franz Ferdinand's advisers and supported his Greater Austrian reform plans,  the Reichspost reacted vehemently to the murder of the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne in 1914 and its journalism fueled the outbreak of World War I.  In the 1920s, the newspaper evolved into a kind of organ of the government because all the federal chancellors of the newly created Republic of Austria, with the exception of Karl Renner and Johann Schober, came from the Christian Social Party."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:19","text":"The politics of Ignaz Seipel in particular met with Funder's unreserved support.  Seipel was not only a moral theologian and chairman of the Christian Social Party, as well as federal chancellor and federal minister on several occasions, but since 1917 he had also been chairman of the Catholic publishing house Herold, which issued the Reichspost.  The newspaper welcomed Seipel's anti-Marxist policy and his advocacy of the Austrian Home Guards, which he encouraged as a \"bulwark against bolshevism.\" Hence it is unsurprising that the Reichspost supported Federal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss from the outset, another friend of Funder's.  As the semiofficial mouthpiece of the Dollfuss cabinet, from March 1933 the newspaper championed the establishment of an \"authoritarian democracy,\" which should be organized as a corporative state (Ständestaat).  With this pro-government editorial policy, the Reichspost attempted to dissociate itself from the emerging Nazi dictatorship in Germany on the one hand and from the political opponents in Austria on the other, who would allegedly abuse parliamentarianism and freedom of opinion for strategical party-political purposes. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:20","text":"In his memoirs, in which he discusses the Reichspost a great deal, Funder compares a newspaper to a state: \"under a unified leadership its administration is divided into specialized fields that have their respective experts and comprise all areas of human activity.\"  The comparison is apparently not based on a democratic form of government but on a corporative state as envisaged by Dollfuss. While authoritarian leadership is the responsibility of the federal chancellor or editor in chief, human activities are uniformly represented by professions or departments. This representative administration was also expressed in the infrastructure of the Reichspost, which in 1913 moved within Josefstadt, Vienna's eighth district, from Strozzigasse 41, a small suburban building,  to Strozzigasse 8, where the new Herold publishing house was constructed on lot of around one thousand square meters.  The building's communication center, designed as a \"representative space,\" comprised the office of the editor in chief, who had at his command the \"master station\" of the American telephone system and was able to send manuscripts straight to the composing room by pneumatic dispatch. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:21","text":"In Funder's opinion a print newspaper should be headed by a leading article in the same way that the state required a leader and the editorial team an editor in chief. For this reason, the editorial was always printed on the front page in the Reichspost, followed by the day's political, local, ecclesiastical, cultural, and financial news and opinion pieces, as well as by the classified section at the back. Although this genre of journalistic text, which critically comments on an aspect of current affairs in the name of the newspaper or periodical, can be traced back to the early eighteenth century, the term \"leading article\" or \"editorial\" only emerged in the early nineteenth century.  The reason is the formally leading role of the article, which only became possible when newspapers no longer printed a series of news items, but different departments and then front pages with the day's headlines emerged."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:22","text":"Typically, therefore, the leading article can be found on the front page and comments on the item in the newspaper that the editorial team considers most important. In its leading position it is also intended to be an introduction to the subsequent articles and texts. As is shown by \"Undesirable Visit,\" the leading article does not perform this leadership task in terms of content alone. More than just telling the readers what they should think, the leading article demonstrates how to think. It starts with a particular occasion or event, a current news item, approaches it from different angles, and ultimately takes up a specific position. Every day this process—from facts to argumentation to interpretation—demonstrates how a judgment is formed. Whereas the essays of the London-based magazines in the early eighteenth century—such as in Daniel Defoe's Review or Jonathan Swift's Examiner—were often playful attempts to approach a matter subjectively,  the strict format of the leading article prescribes a general thought pattern. As a rule it is not an individual subject, not an author, but the collective imagination of a newspaper that represents a part of reality in the leading article."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Undesirable Visit\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/2?lang=en&info=full#p:23","text":"There may have been technical reasons behind Funder's demand for sovereign leadership and representative order, whether of the state or of the newspaper: the way newspapers were produced at the time demonstrated to him every day the chaos of the characters.

In accordance with Funder's typographic experience, it was therefore necessary to keep these arbitrary signs together, literally to form them.

However, in 1688 the sculptor Johann Bernhard Fischer from Graz, who had trained as an architect in Rome, presented a design for an imperial palace to Leopold I that was to be constructed in Schönbrunn. It can be presumed that Fischer hoped to achieve two things with this oversized project, namely on the one hand to demonstrate his architectural skill and on the other to design a residence that would befit the House of Habsburg. In the engraving of the design, which was produced by Johann Adam Delsenbach and published by Fischer in 1721, several terraces lead from the river Wien up to the palace, which is positioned on the crest of the Schönbrunn hill like an otherworldly object.  The literature often compares Fischer's Schönbrunn project from 1688 with the Palace of Versailles, which Louis XIV had converted into a residence from the 1660s.  In competition with the French king, who famously styled himself as the Roi-Soleil, references to the architecture of antiquity and the sun god Apollo were intended to stress that the Habsburgs were the legitimate heirs of the Roman emperors."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Schönbrunn","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/3?lang=en&info=full#p:8","text":"Although this premier projet for Schönbrunn was never realized, Fischer was appointed the architecture teacher of the heir to the throne the following year, 1689.  For him, the future Emperor Joseph I, he now planned a feasible hunting retreat (Jagdschloss), which was constructed from the mid-1690s on the site of the Katterburg and integrated elements of the original building. According to an engraving published by Fischer, the path to the retreat led through a gate with two obelisks, across a spacious cour d'honneur, to a rounded ramp from which guests could access—via a perron—first a columned hall and then the ballroom of the bel étage, which on the opposite side offered a prospect of the garden.  In Fischer's floor plan, the state and private apartments are arranged in an enfilade, meaning threaded (French enfiler) along an axis, in the right, west wing.  In fact, the initial plan only envisaged the construction of the central wing, the corps de logis with its seventeen axes, which was opened amid festivities in spring 1700. However, two wings were subsequently added to the retreat at the suggestion of Leopold I in order to accommodate the entire court. In other words, around 1700 Schönbrunn had been upgraded from a mere hunting retreat or pleasure-house (Lustschloss) to an imperial residence. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Schönbrunn","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/3?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"Yet the premature death of Joseph I in 1711 meant that this construction work remained unfinished.

Instead of the access ramp designed by Fischer, two curved perrons were constructed on each side, which made it possible for carriages to travel unhindered across the cour d'honneur, through the palace, and straight into the garden.  Imperial Garden Engineer (Garteningenieur) Jean Trehet had already started laying out the palace gardens in 1695.  He took Fischer's schematic garden design, which was still in the tradition of the Renaissance with its beds arranged in a square grid, merely as a guide. Instead, the Parisian Trehet realized a French Baroque garden, which combined parterres and bosquets, i.e., level flower beds and formal hedges.  While Maria Theresa devoted herself to the alteration of the palace building in the mid-eighteenth century, her husband Francis I Stephen, supported by experts from his homeland of Lorraine, turned his attention to the redesign of the palace gardens.  Among other things, he had the Great Parterre elongated to the foot of the Schönbrunn hill and added to the right-angled network of avenues two large diagonal axes, which radiate from the palace into the garden as a patte d'oie, meaning in the shape of a goose's foot.  In 1779, a year before Maria Theresa's death, the majority of Schönbrunn's gardens were opened to the public. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Schönbrunn","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/3?lang=en&info=full#p:10","text":"The status of the palace grounds subsequently became dependent on both the political climate and the personal preferences of the respective ruler.

During his reign, the residential and working areas were located in the west wing of the building; a private apartment for his wife Elisabeth was set up on the ground floor. After Francis Joseph's death in Schönbrunn in 1916, his successor, Charles I, planned alterations to the palace, which would never come to pass.

Over the course of the 1920s, a motley range of individuals, societies, and organizations moved into and out of Schönbrunn, e.g., the war-wounded, the Social Democratic association \"Kinderfreunde\" (\"Friends of Children\"), a bourgeois private school, the Boy Scouts, and a youth hostel. In addition, not long after the war had ended, the Habsburgs' private and state apartments were converted into a museum.

Yet the palace building only played a role in the event to the extent that it provided the backdrop for the rally being held in its garden, for which Home Guard members had traveled from all over Austria in special \"Homeland Protection chartered trains\" (Heimatschutz-Sonderzüge). The logistics for the celebration were regulated by instructions, which had been published shortly beforehand by the federal leadership of the Homeland Protection League.  In addition to the train timetables, the brochure contained instructions on the dress code (green Home Guard jacket), hygiene (tallow feet), provisions (cocoa and bread), and some rules of conduct (such as the advice that smoking was prohibited during the field Mass). A vital part of these instructions was the plans and information about the \"march to the assembly area,\" which explained in detail how the occupants of the twenty-three chartered trains should march to the palace gardens and then to the Great Parterre, i.e., the area between the palace and the Schönbrunn hill."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Schönbrunn","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/3?lang=en&info=full#p:13","text":"These maps demonstrate the marching routes from the east through the Meidling gates into the gardens  and the arrangement of the troops on the area in front of the palace.  All routes led to the palace's south terrace, where the altar for the field Mass and the speakers' podium would be set up.

The top is crowned with a golden eagle, which mediates between heaven and earth like the sovereign. The Obelisk Fountain is connected thematically to the neighboring Roman Ruin, which was completed one year later.  Likewise constructed as the focal point of an avenue, this garden structure shows an ancient building, which is half sunken in the ground and which, according to its original name, was intended to represent Carthage, the North African city that the Romans had destroyed in the Punic Wars. Therefore, the Schönbrunn ruin alludes to the vanquished enemies of the House of Habsburg, whose claim to eternal reign, dating back to the Roman Empire, is not only embodied in the obelisk and the Gloriette but is also the conceptual foundation of the statues around the Great Parterre. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Schönbrunn","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/3?lang=en&info=full#p:18","text":"The counterpart to the obelisk in the west is the pavilion in the zoo at the end of the diagonal avenue on the Hietzing side, which can also be seen from the palace terrace.

His architect from Lorraine, Jean-Nicolas Jadot, designed an octagonal pavilion on a round square from which sixteen axes radiate out: three avenues, an administration building, and twelve animal enclosures, which were designed as small Baroque gardens.  It was only possible to look into them from the center, where the imperial couple would breakfast in the pavilion and observe the animals in the panorama, which had been brought to the imperial residence from all over the world. Moreover, below the menagerie, on the west edge of the palace garden, Francis Stephen had a botanical garden laid out, which was named after the homeland of its gardeners. Partly procured during expeditions, the plant populations of the Dutch Garden were arranged in square sections according to the taxonomy of the Swedish botanist Carl von Linné, the so-called Linnaean system.  In the Baroque palace grounds of Schönbrunn, whether in the parterres and avenues or in the menagerie and the botanical garden, nature was controlled rationally, which meant first and foremost geometrically. "},{"type":"title","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"Fascism as Tragedy"},{"type":"keywords","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full","text":"leader Engelbert Dollfuss authoritarian democracy Austria Vienna 1933 Napoleon Bonaparte Paris nation national theater Leviathan High German Duce ballroom Rudolph Lothar Emil Ludwig Heinz Kindermann Joseph II Hofburgtheater Champ de Mai Theater nächst dem Kärntnerthor drama Theater nächst der Burg Campo di maggio Giovacchino Forzano Champ de Mars 1815 tragedy Werner Krauss parliamentarianism Géza Herczeg Joseph Fouché France Burgtheater Hundred Days Hanns Sassmann Benito Mussolini Hermann Röbbeling"},{"type":"image","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#i:133","text":"Benito Mussolini (on the left) and Emil Ludwig in the Pallazo Venezia in Rome in spring 1932, printed as frontispiece in Emil Ludwig: Mussolinis Gespräche mit Emil Ludwig, Berlin: Zsolnay 1932, p.&nbsp;2.

At a cursory glance, there seems to be no relation between the political rally and the theatrical production. A closer examination of the two events, however, reveals a dense web of personal and thematic connections, mainly linked by Benito Mussolini, the founder of Fascism who was appointed Italy's prime minister in 1922. Mussolini was not only the financial backer of the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" and a patron of its initiator, Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg,  but also the coauthor of the play, which had premiered in Rome in 1930 under the title Campo di maggio and covers Napoleon's rule during the Hundred Days between his exile on the islands of first Elba and then Saint Helena. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:3","text":"The German author Emil Ludwig,  who achieved international fame in the 1920s with historical biographies, was told by Mussolini that his book on Napoleon had inspired him to sketch out a drama, which he then had Giovacchino Forzano finalize.  Forzano, an established dramatist and librettist in Italy at the time, corroborated this portrayal of events and later published the following letter:"},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:4","text":"Dear Forzano,I am sending you the paper, crumpled as it is from lying on my desk for so long, which contains the title and the four acts inspired by reading Ludwig's Napoleon, which I told you about.

Founded in the eighteenth century, the traditional Viennese stage had run into serious financial trouble, to the extent that in the early 1930s there was talk of a \"Burgtheater crisis\" and even the threat of its closure. In order to gain control of the situation, the education ministry, which was responsible for the theater, searched for a new manager for the Burgtheater who would have not only artistic skill but also financial experience. The man they chose was Hermann Röbbeling, who had successfully run the Schauspielhaus and the Thalia Theater in Hamburg as private companies.  Röbbeling assumed the management of the Burgtheater in December 1931 and soon lived up to his reputation for restoring theaters to profitability: he invited the press to dress rehearsals, had performances broadcast live on the radio, negotiated reduced federal rail tickets for theatergoers, expanded the season ticket system, and introduced weekly performances for school students. However, this financial success was accompanied by vehement criticism of the alleged commercialization of the Burgtheater. Ideologically, Röbbeling was guided primarily by the conservative and increasingly authoritarian notions of his most important financier, the Austrian federal government. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:8","text":"A good example of the artistic and economic orientation of the Burgtheater under Hermann Röbbeling is the festival cycle \"Voices of the Peoples in Drama\" (Stimmen der Völker im Drama), which he retrospectively declared his \"greatest success.\"  At the very beginning of his tenure, in February 1932, he had given a talk at the Österreichische Völkerbundliga (Austrian Alliance of the League of Nations), which emphasized the association of nations furthered by theater: he argued that plays from antiquity to the present day made one aware that though people may have cultural differences, at heart they are all connected.  In the Almanach der österreichischen Bundestheater for the 1932/33 season, Röbbeling then explained the meaning of this particular series of works at the Burgtheater: \"a representative piece of literature is intended to bring to the stage a specific national character and create understanding for another type of people and a peculiar artistic expression.\"  Having launched in October 1932 with Franz Grillparzer's \"Austrian tragedy\" Ein Bruderzwist in Habsburg (Fraternal Strife among the Habsburgs), the cycle was intended to continue with a series of fifteen foreign works,  but by 1938 only twelve productions had been realized. The play that was originally planned for Italy was La Gioconda by Gabriele D'Annunzio, but the Italian \"national character\" was ultimately represented by two other dramas, which were not initially conceived as part of the cycle but were retrospectively ascribed to it, namely Campo di maggio by Forzano and Mussolini and Carlo Goldoni's comedy Il bugiardo. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"Röbbeling's management and his cycle \"Voices of the Peoples in Drama\" unfolded against a backdrop of a public debate about the Austrian \"national theater,\" which dated back to the eighteenth century and underwent a marked resurgence in the First Republic. The question when exactly the Burgtheater itself was founded cannot be answered with just one year.  Emperor Leopold I had already opened a large court theater in Vienna's Hofburg Palace around 1700, where later the Redoutensäle ballrooms were constructed. Subsequently, Maria Theresa had the vacant Hofballhaus, where court tennis had been played, on (what is now) Michaelerplatz converted into the Theater nächst der Burg (Theater by the Palace) from the 1740s and run by leaseholders.  Predominantly French dramas and Italian operas were performed there, in accordance with the language customs of the nobility, while in the popular Theater nächst dem Kärntnerthor comedies were improvised in German or Viennese dialect, plays in which the character of the Hanswurst buffoon always made an appearance. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:10","text":"Under the aegis of Joseph von Sonnenfels, the views of literary figures who advocated a German \"national theater\" like Johann Christoph Gottsched and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing spread through the Viennese bourgeoisie from the 1760s. However, this expression certainly did not imply popularity (Volkstümlichkeit) in the sense of the Kärntnertor theater, but rather a \"regular\" stage with unvarying, High German, moralizing texts. Maria Theresa's son, Emperor Joseph II, who was not averse to the ideas of the Enlightenment, ultimately decreed in a letter from March 23, 1776, that the Theater nächst der Burg, which his mother had had constructed, be run in future as \"the German National Theater [das teutsche National Theater].\"  Nevertheless, the purely German-language repertoire barely lasted two months, and even the title National Theater was soon changed to Die Kaiserlich-Königlichen National-Hofschauspieler (The Imperial Royal National Court Players), until in the nineteenth century the name K.K. Hofburgtheater (Imperial Royal Hofburg Palace Theater) became established,  which was also adopted for the newly built theater on Vienna's Ringstrasse when it was opened in 1888. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:11","text":"In 1934 Rudolph Lothar published an updated and augmented edition of his Burgtheater history from 1899.

The Vienna court—unlike that in Paris, for example—had, however, never been \"national,\" he continued, but rather a colorful medley of European noble families. \"The truly national art of Vienna and thus Austria lay somewhere else entirely,\" Lothar explained, \"it could be found on the squares of the inner city and the suburbs, in shacks and sports halls and sprouted its funny flowers in the improvised farce and in the extemporized burlesque.\" The Hofburgtheater had emerged as a \"protest against this elemental art\"; it had wanted to \"dethrone and kill the national Hanswurst.\"  The most important task of Hermann Röbbeling, the new manager, was to run the Burgtheater as the truly \"national theater of Austria,\" it says at the end of the book, and to cultivate Austrian drama as the \"strongest expression of down-to-earth patriotism.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:12","text":"Five years later, when the corporative state was already history and the \"Ostmark\" had become part of the Greater German Reich, another book on the Burgtheater was published, this time by the German philologist Heinz Kindermann, who was promoted to head of the newly founded department of theater studies at the University of Vienna in 1943. While Lothar had wanted to derive Austrian national theater from the folk art of Vienna, Kindermann immediately stressed in his foreword that his subtitle \"Legacy and Mission of a National Theater\" (Erbe und Sendung eines Nationaltheaters) did not imply a \"merely Viennese or merely German-Austrian affair,\" but rather a Greater German cultural institution.  He elaborated that the Burgtheater's selection of works first and foremost had to revolve around the \"bountiful dramatic legacy of the Germans,\" while also incorporating the most important pieces from foreign nations in the interests of a \"fruitful encounter with their otherness,\" though \"Shakespeare, whom we perceive to be almost German,\" was excluded from this strict selection. \"As today we think in racially definable national units,\" Kindermann wrote, \"our selection of the drama representing the individual peoples of world literature (in Goethe's sense) will surely look different from that offered by the liberal viewpoint, that is, also different from how Röbbeling's 'Voices of the Peoples in Drama' presented these nations.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:13","text":"Röbbeling's declarations that the cycle was aimed at bringing peoples together may at times have been at odds with the pieces that were actually performed, as can be demonstrated by the example of Hundred Days.

Rather, the citizens of the Fascist state are united in the \"conscious membership of a spiritual society,\"  which has genuine \"personality,\" namely in the form of the Duce, who personally embodies and exemplifies Fascism. This superhuman leader adopts a literally sovereign position: he overarches the nation like Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan and represents the collective will of his subordinate people.  However, in contrast to the monarchical, the Fascist sovereign possesses no dynastic legitimacy. That means that he is not respected because of his noble birth but has to create his own heroic genealogy. Himself from a lower-middle-class family, Mussolini therefore attempted to portray himself as the spiritual descendent of the Roman emperors, while also gladly referring to the Corsican social climber who had crowned himself the \"Emperor of the French\" in the early nineteenth century."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"Napoleon is certainly described as an exemplary self-made man in Emil Ludwig's historical biography  that inspired the drama Campo di maggio.

That night, Napoleon is less concerned by Fouché's intrigues and the impending war than by his son's return. When the emissary finally arrives from Vienna, the emperor believes he can also hear his beloved child in the anteroom but is soon bitterly disappointed. Napoleon had planned to ride on the Champ de Mars in the \"Austerlitz uniform\" alongside his son in the carriage.

Yet in the name of the representatives, General Lafayette insists on Napoleon's resignation, who had himself become the greatest barrier to peace. Reluctantly, but to prevent a civil war, the emperor abdicates in favor of his son. The representatives' expectations that they would be able to negotiate a ceasefire with the victorious powers are revealed in the third act to be a naïve illusion. Instead, the enemy generals dictate humiliating peace terms to the conquered French: Louis XVIII will be brought back as king, Fouché appointed his prime minister, France subjected to military occupation, and Napoleon exiled to a distant island, probably Saint Helena.

Instead of coming together patriotically behind Napoleon, the elected representatives of the people allow themselves to be blinded by Fouché, a conniving, lying, extorting, cajoling career politician who is concerned only for his own self-interest.  In contrast, Napoleon appears in the play as a brave soldier and loving family man, as man of the people and charismatic genius who makes but a single—though grave—mistake in his hundred-day reign, namely not wanting to rule as a military dictator but as a constitutional monarch. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Fascism as Tragedy","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/4?lang=en&info=full#p:20","text":"This fundamental conflict—Napoleon/people vs. Fouché/parliament—is the clear leitmotif of Campo di maggio and the German translation Hundert Tage, but the Burgtheater production intensifies this even further.  The text of the performance as documented in the promptbook was written by the dramatist and journalist Hanns Sassmann, whom Lothar calls an \"arch Austrian\" in his history of the Burgtheater from 1934,  in collaboration with Burgtheater Manager Röbbeling, who also directed the play. Their reworking cuts out the second scene of the third act, where an envoy of Fouché encounters Wellington, changes some of the speaking roles, and makes revisions throughout the text.

Far from despotically exploiting his imperial power, he always appears composed and under control; and when he does briefly lose his poise, he regains his composure immediately.

The melody sounds the same in both cases, but in Schönbrunn it is only instrumental, whereas during the protests the following lyrics can be heard: \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt!\" (literally, \"Germany, Germany above all, above all else in the world!\").

His piece, Gott, erhalte den Kaiser (\"God Preserve the Emperor\"), evolved with alternate lyrics into the Austrian imperial anthem, but also served in 1841 as the musical foundation for the Lied der Deutschen (\"Song of the Germans\") by the German philologist and poet August Heinrich Hoffmann, who came from the north German village of Fallersleben, a song that would go on to be declared the national anthem of the Weimar Republic in 1922. In contrast, the Austrian chancellor, the Social Democrat Karl Renner, felt that the melody's monarchical history made it an unsuitable symbol for a republican state, which is why he himself wrote an anthem for Deutschösterreich (\"German-Austria\") in 1920 and had his friend Wilhelm Kienzl set it to music. Scarcely ten years later, the ruling Christian Social Party used a constitutional reform as an opportunity to officially introduce the former \"Emperor's Hymn\" (Kaiserlied), now with new lyrics by the priest and poet Ottokar Kernstock, as the Austrian national anthem. Consequently, when Haydn's traditional melody was played in Vienna in the early 1930s, it could have been praising three different political sovereigns: the Habsburg emperor, the German people, or the Austrian state."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:4","text":"\"God Preserve the Emperor\" was created at a time when the emperor certainly could have benefited from some divine assistance.  Even before Francis, the heir to the Habsburg throne, was crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in July 1792, revolutionary France had declared war on him in April. The military conflicts dragged on for years, with victories and defeats on both sides, until the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte resoundingly prevailed over Austrian troops in northern Italy. These decisive battles were fought in 1796, the year when Count Franz Josef von Saurau, then the provincial president of Lower Austria, commissioned the \"meritorious poet\" Lorenz Leopold Haschka to write \"a national song just like that of the English,\" which would proclaim \"to the whole world the people's loyal allegiance to their good and righteous sovereign.\"  While the song God Save the King, which had been sung in honor of British kings since the mid-eighteenth century, served as the model, the commissioned piece was probably also directed against the militant Marseillaise, which had originated with the declaration of war against Austria and had been the French national anthem since 1795. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:5","text":"Thematically, Haschka closely aligned his words with the English model, likewise calling on god to protect the monarch.  Metrically, however, he did not abide by the three-quarter time of God Save the King with its mostly dactylic feet of one stressed and two unstressed syllables: \"Send him victorious, / Happy and glorious,\" etc.  Instead, for his lyrics, Haschka opted for the (double) ballad stanza then very common in German poetry, choosing the title Gott, erhalte den Kaiser (\"God Preserve the Emperor\"). "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:6","text":"God preserve our Emp'ror Francis,Sov'reign ever good and great!Save, O save him from mischancesIn felicity and state!May his days be crown'd with glory,Laurel wreathes his pate may braid!God preserve our Emp'ror Francis,Sov'reign ever good and great!From his glorious banners streaming,May success and plenty grow!In his councils brightly beaming,O may wisdom, prudence flow;Fill the hearts of his advisersWith integrity and grace!God preserve our Emp'ror Francis,Sov'reign ever good and great!All thy bounties good and graciousPour on him, his house, and realm!And in mercy, plots audaciousWith confusion overwhelm!By thy law may he be guided,Our laws his will creates!God preserve our Emp'ror Francis,Sov'reign ever good and great!May he see his countries flourishAnd his peoples crown'd with joy!Love fraternal may they nourishAnd all seeds of hate destroy!May he hear his offspring cryingWhen on brink of distant grave:God preserve our Emp'ror Francis,Sov'reign ever good and great! "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:7","text":"From a formal perspective, every stanza of the German original comprises eight so-called trochaic tetrameters, with an abab rhyme scheme and alternately stressed and unstressed line endings.

In the refrain, the song's chorus, the words \"Gott/God\" and \"Franz/Francis\" are thus not only repeated, but also emphasized. This regular emphasis corresponds to the prayer-like nature of the lyrics, which ask god to protect Francis as the victorious, well-advised, and legitimate emperor. Although Count Saurau, the initiator, speaks of a \"national song,\" it is not in fact about a nation living together according to its own laws. Rather, several \"countries\" and \"peoples\" are united under the monarchical sovereign, whose divinely inspired will is the law for his subjects: \"By thy law may he be guided, / Our laws his will creates!\" (\"Dein Gesetz sey stets Sein Wille; / Dieser uns Gesetzen gleich!\"). "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:8","text":"Therefore, Haschka delivered what had been expected of him, namely a hymn to the emperor, realized in a lyrically familiar form that had been used, for example, by Friedrich Schiller in his Ode to Joy, published in 1786.  Between October 1796 and January 1797, Haschka's text was set to music by Joseph Haydn, who had heard God Save the King in England and had himself suggested the creation of a similar national song in Austria.  He was very fond of the result, his \"Emperor's Song\" (Kaiserlied),  and not only did he vary the melody immediately in the \"Kaiserquartett\" (\"emperor's quartet,\" op. 76, no. 3), but toward the end of his life he supposedly played it daily on the piano.  \"God Preserve the Emperor\" was first performed on the occasion of the twenty-ninth birthday of Francis II on February 12, 1797, at the Hofburgtheater in Vienna.  The lyrics were distributed among the audience on handbills and sung to Haydn's score in the first interval of the opera performance.  As the ministerial Wiener Zeitung reported ten days later, the \"national song\" had been written by the \"most famous composer of our age\" and was received with enthusiasm by both the \"dear sovereign\" and his \"loyal subjects.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"Gott erhalte was created as an ode to the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.  However, the song only became the official imperial anthem after Francis II had proclaimed the Austrian Empire in 1804, in light of Napoleon's designation as Emperor of the French, and had abdicated as German emperor in 1806, in light of the founding of the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon. He dissolved the Holy Roman Empire and now reigned as Francis I, Emperor of Austria, the Habsburg crown lands.  It was predominantly in 1809 that the Gott erhalte anthem was used officially, when the Austrian army under Archduke Charles, the emperor's brother, first conquered the Napoleonic troops, and then in 1814/15 at numerous events in the context of the Congress of Vienna, where Europe's national borders were redrawn after the abdication of Napoleon.  That the hymn was only adopted by the army in 1826, three decades after its creation, might be related to Haydn's solemn melody, which was not well suited as a battle cry. However, another reason is the lacking nationality of this multilingual army, which was \"Austrian\" in name only. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:10","text":"After Francis I died in 1835, two new sets of lyrics were written for his son Ferdinand, but they both remained unpopular.  Then, under Emperor Francis Joseph I, the demand made by the writer Adalbert Stifter and others for the creation of generally applicable, permanent lyrics was finally met. The poet suggested by Stifter, namely Franz Grillparzer, reluctantly attempted the task, but even he was dissatisfied with the result. Ultimately, a draft by Johann Gabriel Seidl was chosen, at the time the curator of the imperial royal coin and antiquities collection, whose new \"People's Hymn\" (Volkshymne) was published in the Wiener Zeitung on April 9, 1854.  Aside from a variable additional stanza, Seidl's text no longer honors the individual ruler but begins with the lines: \"Gott erhalte, Gott beschütze / Unsern Kaiser, unser Land!\" (literally, \"God preserve, God protect / Our emperor, our country!\"). At the end of the first stanza, the name of this country is uttered, though \"Austria's destiny\" (\"Österreichs Geschick\") remains closely tied to \"the Habsburg throne\" (\"Habsburgs Throne\").  The \"Emperor's Hymn\" had thus evolved into a kind of family hymn, which quotes two Habsburg mottoes in the fourth stanza:"},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:11","text":"Let us stand together firmly:Concord is real powerful;Ruling with united forcesDeeds are done just masterful.Let us join fraternally andMarch together to one score;Hail the Emp'ror, hail the country:Austria forevermore! "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:12","text":"Despite the title \"People's Hymn,\" once again the emperor is at the center of both the lyrics and the country over which he rules by the grace of god.

Yet the House of Habsburg would last \"forevermore,\" at least in the common interpretation of the symbolic device AEIOU as Austria erit in orbe ultima, which Frederick III had inscribed on his property in the fifteenth century.

Although Hoffmann von Fallersleben lost his professorship due to his Unpolitische Lieder, he soon gained fame as a poet and singer.  Another commercial success was Das Lied der Deutschen (\"The Song of the Germans\"), written in late August 1841 on Helgoland, which he immediately published with Hoffmann und Campe in Hamburg.  The title page of this first edition expressly notes: \"Melody after Joseph Haydn's: 'God preserve our Emp'ror Francis, / Sov'reign ever good and great!'\"  Austria, where Ferdinand I had reigned since 1835, does not exist in the Deutschlandlied (\"Song of Germany\"), which reworks the hymn of the last Roman-German emperor into an anthem for a future German nation."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"Germany 'bove ev'rything, yes,Ev'rything within the world,If she always stands togetherFor protection unreserved,From the Maas right to the Memel,Adige up to the Belt—Germany 'bove ev'rything, yes,Ev'rything around the world!German women, German loy'lty,German wine and German song,All around the world they shall beHeard with voices loud and strong,And inspire noble actionsFrom the youth and ev'ryone—German women, German loy'lty,German wine and German song!Unity and right and freedomFor the German fatherland!For this goal let's strive togetherBrotherly with heart and hand!Unity and right and freedomShall be our fortune's stand—Flourish, thrive right in this fortune,Flourish, German fatherland! "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:17","text":"From a rhetorical perspective, Hoffmann's text begins with an ellipsis and hyperbole. In other words, the formulation of the first two lines is incomplete and exaggerated. It is not clear whether Germany is loved or placed above everything. Are these lines intended to express longing for a German nation state or claim its supremacy? The following lines do not provide any more clarity, because both patriotism and national superiority can depend on the people uniting fraternally to defend their country. Regarding the exaggeration, the word \"everything\" denotes either that which is important to a person or, quite differently, the other nations of the world. According to how the two lines are interpreted, they introduce either a patriotic or a nationalistic poem. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:18","text":"The biography of the liberally minded author rather substantiates the patriotic reading. However, that the opening lines presumably allude to the following dictum, speaks for the nationalist interpretation: \"Austria above everything, if she only will!\" (\"Österreich über alles, wenn es nur will!\"). It dates back to a book by the cameralist Philipp Wilhelm von Hörnigk that was published in 1684 with the full title: \"Austria Above Everything, If She Only Will. That Is: Well-Meaning Suggestion How, with the Aid of a Thriving National Economy, the Imperial Hereditary Land Might before Long Rise above All Other States in Europe / and More Than Some / Become Independent of Them.\"  In the year after Vienna's liberation from the Ottoman siege, the text recommends that Leopold I, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, make his hereditary lands economically independent. The aim of this autarky was Austria's political assertion over absolutist France under Louis XIV. For Heinrich Gerstenberg, who edited Hoffmann's works and in 1933 published a study on the Deutschlandlied, Hörnigk's book comprised the \"cradle of our German national anthem.\"  However, the book's title was also claimed by Austrian Federal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, who at the end of his speech at the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" in Schönbrunn on May 14, 1933, quoted \"a simple, old German word\": \"Austria above everything, if she only will!\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:19","text":"So Hoffmann's text loves or places Germany—instead of Austria—\"above everything.\" But what is meant by \"Germany\"? The territory of the yearned-for nation state is defined in the first stanza with reference to four rivers: \"From the Maas right to the Memel, / Adige up to the Belt\" (\"Von der Maas bis an die Memel, / Von der Etsch bis an den Belt\"). According to the anthem, therefore, this \"Germany\" ranged roughly from the Prussian-Netherlandish (Maas) to the Prussian-Lithuanian (Memel) border and from the Baltic Sea (Belt) to South Tirol (Adige). Especially in the east, the territory of the Deutschlandlied extends far beyond that of the German Confederation in 1841. What Hoffmann had in mind was clearly not the existing political boundaries, but rather the border regions of the German language.  Influenced by Romantic literature and the work of the Brothers Grimm, his philological studies were supposed to help document Germanity.  Hoffmann's research into German folksong had a formative influence on his poems. From this German philological perspective, Austria, whose German-speaking territories were included in the \"Song of the Germans,\" was not able to form its own nation state. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:20","text":"Beyond doubt, the National Socialists, who protested against the Home Guard parade in Vienna on May 14, 1933, sang the first stanza of the Deutschlandlied in the sense of a Greater German nation, which had been called for as long ago as the Revolution of 1848. Whereas national liberalism had been advocating \"unity and right and freedom,\" as it says in Hoffmann's text, the supporters of the Nazi regime could hardly appeal to the rule of law and civil liberties. When in 1922 the president of the German Reich, the Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert, declared the \"Song of the Germans\" the national anthem of the Weimar Republic, he referred explicitly to the third stanza, which has also been sung as the national anthem of the Federal Republic of Germany since 1952.  In contrast, the Nazi regime combined the first stanzas of the Deutschlandlied and the Horst-Wessel-Lied, the NSDAP's martial party anthem.  It was in this order that the songs were sung at the National Socialist \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" on May 13, 1933, at Vienna's Engelmann Arena, an event that was directed against the rally held by the Austrian Homeland Protection the following day. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:21","text":"At the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" in the gardens of Schönbrunn Palace, the band also played Haydn's melody. Which lyrics the assembled Home Guard members sang to it, however, is unclear. Whether by force of habit or out of conviction, many Homeland Protectors might still have sung Seidl's verses from 1854, which had honored the Habsburg emperor until the end of World War I. It is quite probable that only a minority would have known the new lyrics by Ottokar Kernstock, which were declared the national anthem in 1929, by heart.  Besides, it was not the words that were important, but the fact that it was Haydn's song that was now able to ring out again, rather than the unofficial anthem Deutschösterreich (\"German-Austria\") from 1920, which had been composed by Wilhelm Kienzl.  This almost ten-year interlude harked back to Karl Renner's decision not to use the melody of the Emperor's Hymn for the newly founded republic.  However, as the federal army needed an anthem to swear in the troops, the Social Democratic state chancellor himself wrote a text, which extolled \"German-Austria\" as a \"glorious country\" and \"hardworking people.\"  Kienzl set his friend's not especially poetic verses to music, though by his own account he did so unwillingly because his composition had to replace \"Haydn's immortal melody.\"  His doubts were justified, since Renner and Kienzl's anthem proved neither generally known nor popular. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:22","text":"As a result of the discussion of state symbols in the context of the constitutional reform of 1929, in mid-December the cabinet approved a motion by the Christian Social Party to adopt Haydn's melody with lyrics by Ottokar Kernstock as the \"Austrian federal anthem.\"  Renner's song had never officially been decreed, which is why the ministers responsible could simply give official instructions to their departments. Nonetheless, the corresponding decree by the ministry of education from January 31, 1930, was thwarted by the president of Vienna's education authority, the Social Democrat Otto Glöckel, with his directive to the schools of Vienna to sing the first and third stanzas of the Deutschlandlied. Glöckel's attempt \"to promote the national and republican education of the young\"  in this way was in conformity with the Social Democratic party line since the fall of 1918, according to which \"German-Austria\" should join the Weimar Republic. Another decree by the minister of education then specified that while there were generally no objections to be made to the Deutschlandlied, at official events exclusively Kernstock's lyrics were to be used. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:23","text":"The new verses for the old hymn had been created immediately after the end of the world war. Inspired by \"patriotic fellow countrymen,\"  the German Nationalist poet Ottokar Kernstock, who lived as a Catholic priest in Styria, wrote a poem to the tune of Haydn's \"Emperor's Song,\" which was distributed on a handbill in Graz in 1919. In the original version, each of the stanzas ends in the line: \"God with thee, German-Austria!\" (\"Gott mit dir, Deutschösterreich!\").  For the version printed in his last volume of poetry Der redende Born in 1922, Kernstock changed not only \"German-Austria\" to \"my Austria\" in keeping with the political circumstances, but also cut the third stanza, which started with the lines: \"Eastern land you have been called and / From the East there comes the light\" (\"Osterland bis du geheißen, / Und vom Osten kommt das Licht\").  As the conservative government of the Austrian state did not want to be associated with the \"bolshevist\" East, the cabinet expressly declared only the \"first, second, and fourth stanzas\" the lyrics of the national anthem. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:24","text":"Bless'd be everlastingly, youWonderful and dear homeland!Green of fir and gold of corn fieldsSpan thy country sweet and grand.German labor, true and earnest,German love, so singular:Fatherland, how blissful thou art,God with thee, my Austria!Neither tyranny nor slav'ry!Open way for every strength!Equal rights and equal duties!Free the arts and thoughts at length!Sturdy spirits, steady gazes,Brave and full of character,Climb the ladder of good fortune,God with thee, my Austria!Let's, by no discord divided,Focus on a single goal!Let's in unity and peacefulBuild our future as a whole!Our people's offspring ought toReach their fathers' gloria!Bless'd be our native soil, OGod with thee, my Austria! "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:25","text":"Kernstock's verses read like a \"mixture of 'Gott erhalte' and the Deutschlandlied.\"  No longer is the emperor blessed, but the \"native soil\" (\"Heimaterde\"), which was called \"German homeland\" (\"Deutsche Heimat\") in the first version of the poem.  \"German\" is a descriptor also applied to the \"labor\" and \"love\" of the people who live in this \"fatherland.\" It is given the name \"Austria\" but is described as part of a German national community.  That Kernstock was nevertheless not allowed to call it \"German-Austria,\" was set out under international law in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1919, which also laid down the borders of the newly created state.  \"Austria\" was now no longer a monarchy, but a democratic republic, whose merits are highlighted by the anthem's second stanza. Although the third stanza reminds the reader or singer of the country's history, with its exemplary forefathers, it calls on its youth to recognize and work together to establish \"our Austria constructed in the retort of the dictated peace, no, our crippled Austria,\" as the Christian Social Reichspost phrased it. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Anthem Chaos\"","location":"/topology/mediations/1/mediators/5?lang=en&info=full#p:26","text":"After Haydn's melody had been created as an Emperor's Hymn, Hoffmann von Fallersleben reworked the song as a national anthem. By contrast, Kernstock wrote the lyrics for a state anthem, whose historical and cultural references raise awareness of the mutable nature of the word \"Austria.\" Does it denote the property of a ruling dynasty, the sub-territory of an ethnic community, or an area bounded by international law? That the musical foundation of the anthem enabled all these interpretations became apparent not only at the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" on May 14, 1933, but also five years later, when the official validity period of Kernstock's verses ended. Under pressure from the Nazi regime, Federal Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg announced his resignation on the evening of March 11, 1938, and closed his public address on the radio \"with a German word and a heartfelt wish: God save Austria!\"  His supporters bolstered his speech by shouting \"Austria!,\" whereupon the National Socialists present in the Federal Chancellery struck up the Deutschlandlied. In order to interrupt their singing, Schuschnigg's brother Arthur, who was in charge of the concerts of phonograph recordings at Radio Wien, played an instrumental version of the German-Austrian anthem, namely the second movement of Haydn's \"Kaiserquartett.\"  Whether they witnessed a passing or an awakening was left to the listeners themselves to decide. "},{"type":"title","title":"March on Vienna","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/6?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"March on Vienna"},{"type":"keywords","title":"March on Vienna","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/6?lang=en&info=full","text":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg Homeland Protection Schönbrunn Home Guard Engelbert Dollfuss Austrofascism National Socialism Austria Vienna 1933 parade Richard Steidle military Napoleon Bonaparte Baroque Leopold I Louis XIV corporative state Fascism Benito Mussolini Turks Deliverance Celebration 1683 Turkish siege mass rally hierarchy march-past emperor's advent people's army drill discipline military review mustering marching Korneuburg Oath examination"},{"type":"image","title":"March on Vienna","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/6?lang=en&info=full#i:55","text":"Poster announcing the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" (Türkenbefreiungsfeier) held by the Austrian Homeland Protection (Heimatschutz) in the gardens of Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna on May&nbsp;14, 1933.

That the drill was intended to be more than a practical preparation for war, however, is demonstrated by the Prussian drill regulations from 1743, for example, which state: \"Foremost during a drill must be to tame a fellow and teach him a soldier's air in order to banish the peasant in him […].\"  The aim was a soldierly bearing, which shaped not only the body but also the morale.

As mentioned above, there they feature the intertitle of the Fox Tönende Wochenschau, which had been the German-language version of the American Fox Movietone News since 1929.  According to contemporary film magazines, the following week it was not only Fox that released \"pictures of the Turks Deliverance Celebration in Vienna,\" but also Paramount in their newsreel.  Furthermore, several photographic and filmic documents reveal that the Viennese Selenophon Licht- und Tonbild GmbH  was present in the gardens of Schönbrunn with their recording van.  However, the sound film they produced, which might have been released in the Austrian Engel-Woche, has not survived. Selenophon also produced the \"patriotic newsreel\" Österreich in Bild und Ton (\"Austria in Image and Sound\") on commission from the federal chancellery, which played in movie theaters from June 1933 but which did not contain a piece on the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" of May 14. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Bell & Howell 2709","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/7?lang=en&info=full#p:5","text":"The cameraman was presumably a freelancer and sold his recordings to film companies like Fox or Paramount. Further evidence of this is the camera, which can be seen on the photograph.  Although the model cannot be identified with complete certainty even after looking at the picture under a magnifying glass, the metal frame, the lens turret, the double-compartment film magazine, and the side viewfinder clearly point to the standard model by the American manufacturer Bell & Howell, with the type number 2709.  The camera is mounted on a tripod and was obviously operated using a synchronous motor, which is attached on the right-hand side. This uniform drive made it possible to record not only twenty-four frames per second, but also synchronous optical sound, the equipment for which must have been located inside the car. In any case, the film preserved at the Filmarchiv Austria contains audio recorded on a variable-density track.  That means that the film reel, which is thirty-five millimeters wide and perforated at the edges, has photographic images on the right and the corresponding soundtrack—with uniform area but variable density—next to it on the left.  For this reason, this sound-recording technology came to be known as variable-density recording systems, in contrast to variable-area systems in which the density of the soundtrack remains the same but its width changes, giving rise to a track with a jagged appearance. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Bell & Howell 2709","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/7?lang=en&info=full#p:6","text":"The film camera documented on the photograph was not state of the art around 1933.

Moreover, the Bell & Howell 2709 was a complete studio camera and hence more versatile than a device specially developed for mobile recordings like the aforementioned Eyemo, an upgraded version of which was released with an electric drive motor in 1932. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Bell & Howell 2709","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/7?lang=en&info=full#p:7","text":"Founded in Chicago in 1907, the Bell & Howell company carried the 2709 as its \"standard camera,\" and in the course of a decade the model did in fact become established as the standard camera in American film studios.  However, this description does not refer to its commercial success, but rather the 35 mm format it used, the standardization of which as the \"standard film\" size was in no small part due to this camera and other equipment made by Bell & Howell. The first roll films produced by George Eastman for his Kodak cameras in 1888 were almost seventy millimeters wide. Edison had the 70 mm film halved and used the 35 mm format for his Kinetoscope, a motion picture exhibition device with a peephole for an individual viewer patented in 1893.  However, the wide range of projectors in use around 1900 meant that film widths varied greatly. Donald J. Bell's experience as a projectionist in Chicago meant that he was familiar with the disadvantages of the various formats and perforations.  Even in the instances when a film reel fitted the projector available for the respective screening—the exception rather than the rule—it was to be expected that the reel would repeatedly fall out of the film advance mechanism while cranking. The result in most cases was not the impression of fluid movement, which arises with a constant speed of at least sixteen frames per second. Instead, the projected events ran at an irregular speed; the pictures flickered and jumped around on the screen."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Bell & Howell 2709","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/7?lang=en&info=full#p:8","text":"In well-planned screenings, apparatuses like the Cinématographe by the Lumière brothers,  the Bioscop by the Skladanowsky brothers, or Edison's Vitascope, which were presented to the public in the mid-1890s, may have lived up to the promise of their names and indeed presented life as movement, as conceived by modern biology in the nineteenth century.  In everyday film screenings, however, this illusion could only be enjoyed by those audience members whose concept of life admitted more phenomena than that which their eyes showed them. Donald Bell was aware of the problem due to his work as a projectionist, and the mechanical engineer Albert S. Howell, whom he met in a film workshop, presented a solution with a series of technical innovations that led to the first products of their joint company, Bell & Howell: a contraption to frame images—known as a \"rotary framer\"—for the 35 mm film projector Kinodrome; a perforator to standardize the perforations in 35 mm film; a camera that transported 35 mm film over fixed pilot pins; and a printer that could copy 35 mm film with the same transport mechanism.  In other words, the newly founded company focused entirely on the 35 mm format and its technical solutions ensured that film would pass through recording and projection devices reliably and at a uniform speed."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Bell & Howell 2709","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/7?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"The first camera produced by Bell & Howell was already equipped with the innovative film movement mechanism for stable exposure, but it was still clad in wood and leather. This was followed in 1912 by the 2709 model, whose mechanism and casing—in contrast to all movie cameras developed until that point—were made entirely of metal.  Two magazines were mounted on the camera, one for unexposed and one for exposed film.  Another feature of the camera was the turret for four lenses, which not only simplified the cameraperson's job, but was also essential for focusing.  In order to get a subject in focus, the camera had to be shifted from right to left on a metal base attached to a tripod and the lens turret turned 180 degrees. Then the cameraperson could adjust the lens without exposing the film.  It was also the only opportunity to see precisely what would later be filmed, because the viewfinder mounted on the left side of the camera showed the respective subject from a perspective laterally offset from the recording lens—a so-called \"parallax error,\" which had not yet been corrected at that time.  Also worth mentioning is the fact that the hand crank in the 2709 model was supported by ball bearings, which made the drive easier and also added to the image quality. Bell & Howell's standard camera would be manufactured until 1958. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Bell & Howell 2709","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/7?lang=en&info=full#p:10","text":"The film camera used at the beginning of the upper Mariahilfer Strasse in Vienna at noon on May 14, 1933, was in all probability the 2709-B1 model by Bell & Howell. This version could record up to twenty-six frames per second and was not sound insulated.  The operating sound of the camera, comparable to a sewing machine, only became a problem with the general transition to sound film in the late 1920s. While the film studios had developed sound-absorbing cases known as \"blimps,\" the manufacturers worked on making quieter cameras. With the models NC (1932) and BNC (1934), Mitchell responded better to this technological challenge than Bell & Howell, who concentrated more and more on the amateur film business with cameras and projectors for the 16 mm format.   However, sound film necessitated not only a reduction in camera sounds, but also a constant recording speed of twenty-four frames per second in order to synchronize sound and image. There had been an electric drive motor for the 2709 model since 1919, which was mounted on the back and considerably smaller than the solid synchronous motor used by the cameraman at the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration.\"  In the photograph, he is grasping it with his right hand, presumably to pan the camera back to the parade, though deliberate focusing would not have been possible. Whether the recordings could be used would only become clear once the film had been developed."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Bell & Howell 2709","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/7?lang=en&info=full#p:11","text":"In this case, despite having filmed from the roof of a moving sedan, the cameraman appears to have captured his subject well enough to present his recordings in the subsequent edition of the Fox Tönende Wochenschau. They captured the movement of the parade in twenty-four frames per second (and in a soundtrack recorded using variable-density technology) on a 35 mm film. His \"fondest hope\" for the movie industry had always been standardization, wrote Donald Bell in a letter to the magazine International Photographer in 1930.  In the three decades since he had left his job as a projectionist in Chicago, the 35 mm format, promoted by the company he had founded with Albert Howell, had become established around the world. From a formal perspective, there was now barely any difference between the pictures on the professional film market, and neither during recording nor projection was it possible to manually influence how quickly the film reel passed through the equipment. This is why on May 14, 1933, not only the Austrian Home Guard members, but also the pictures that document their \"march on Vienna,\" moved in lockstep. Thus the film's format mirrored the uniformity of its subject."},{"type":"title","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"Perceptual Gymnastics"},{"type":"keywords","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full","text":"optical sound newsreel Alfred Hitchcock Turkestan 1905 sound-on-disc biomechanics N.S.

The aim of his montage technique was to have as great an impact as possible on the audience. From a purely technical point of view, the montage ideal is achieved in the sequence from the feature film Hitchcock (2012) by Sacha Gervasi in which the premiere of the thriller Psycho is shown. Played by Anthony Hopkins, the director Alfred Hitchcock is initially in the projection booth as he watches the audience react tensely to the action on screen. Then during the most famous scene of Psycho, in which Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is stabbed to death under the shower, Hitchcock is shown in the movie theater's foyer and, in time with the film's soundtrack, conducts the viewers as they flinch and scream to the same rhythm as his edits. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:10","text":"The notion of the director being a conductor of the actors and audience alike is not only applicable to Hitchcock, but also to Eisenstein and his teacher Vsevolod Meyerhold, who became a pioneer of Constructivist theater after the Russian Revolution of 1917.  For Meyerhold, the director was the author of a theatrical staging and the audience its active participant. He viewed movement as the central aspect of theater, vehemently advocating stylized and rejecting realistic forms of representation. Around 1920 he developed a system for training actors that he called biomechanics and that was based on principles of Taylorism and reflexology.  Meyerhold adopted methods of \"scientific management\" from the American engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor in order to increase the efficiency of body movements (e.g., through rhythmization). The Russian school of objective psychology, established by Vladimir Bekhterev and Ivan Pavlov, influenced his biomechanics insofar as emotional states were supposed to be evoked reflexively by physical stimuli. For this purpose, the director commanded his actors to rehearse exercises that he put together from very diverse fields. He adapted combinations of movements from modern gymnastics, boxing training, military drills, circus art, and theatrical traditions like Japanese Kabuki or the Italian Commedia dell'Arte. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:11","text":"In the promptbooks, Meyerhold noted down precise instructions for the action on stage to accompany every line of text.  Eisenstein, who had worked as a military engineer and set designer for the Communist agitprop theater, was first introduced to biomechanics as a course participant and then as Meyerhold's assistant.  In 1923 he went on to stage Alexander Ostrovsky's comedy Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man and called his directorial concept a \"montage of attractions\":"},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:12","text":"An attraction (in our diagnosis of theatre) is any aggressive moment in theatre, i.e. any element of it that subjects the audience to emotional or psychological influence, verified by experience and mathematically calculated to produce specific emotional shocks in the spectator in their proper order within the whole. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:13","text":"As a theater engineer, the director mounts attractions in the sense of independent performances, which do not portray a plot realistically but are intended to give the audience an emotional shock and influence them ideologically.

In an article from 1929, he relates the metric montage that sets the audience in motion by making, for example, \"the hands and feet quiver\" to the intellectual montage where \"this quivering, provoked by an intellectual stimulant combined differently, produces an identical reaction in the tissues of the higher nervous system of the thought apparatus.\"  According to Eisenstein's stimulant-reaction-technique, using a montage of visual objects, whether they be human actors or not, the director could affect the audience as a physical \"material\" and \"plough its psyche.\"  In the eyes of Walter Benjamin, this \"shock effect of film\" was consistent with everyday life in the modern metropolises of the twentieth century and \"seeks to induce heightened attention.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:15","text":"Therefore, in contrast to the clumsy editing in the N.S. Ton-Bild-Bericht Nr. 2, artistic montage was not intended to achieve its effects via the content shown, but rather affect the viewers' perceptual apparatus directly. With Battleship Potemkin, which premiered in Moscow in 1925, Eisenstein appears to have accomplished this perfectly.  His contemporaries spoke of this film, dealing with the mutiny on the warship \"Potemkin\" in the Russian Revolution of 1905, as having both physical and psychological impacts. For the censured German version, which came to cinemas in spring 1926, the Viennese composer Edmund Meisel devised the score.  The management of the film company Prometheus, which produced and distributed the German Battleship Potemkin, wrote to Eisenstein about the premiere in Berlin, emphasizing Meisel's achievement: \"The music was at times so intense that in combination with the pictures on the screen it had such an impact on the viewers that they had to hold onto their seats in excitement.\"  Regarding the ideological impact, the Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels highlighted in March 1933 that Battleship Potemkin had been \"marvelously made. […] Those who are not steadfast in their worldview might become bolshevists as a result of this film.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"The German version of Eisenstein's most famous film was censured again in summer 1926 and then rereleased two years later in a slightly altered form by the Prometheus distribution company. This 1,464-meter-long Battleship Potemkin from 1928 ultimately served as the basis for a sound version for which not only did Meisel compose new music and sound effects, but dialogues and chants were also post-dubbed.  Whether the screening in Vienna on the night of May 13, 1933, was of a silent version with a musical accompaniment or the sound version of 1930, which had been made using the sound-on-disc technique, is not possible to establish for certain. According to archival documents, combined optical sound and sound-on-disc equipment was installed at the Friedensbrücken Kino in 1931, which was replaced that same year with a model by the German Klangfilm GmbH.  Although Klangfilm used the optical sound technique, it also offered additional equipment that made it possible to screen synchronous sound-on-disc films, i.e., with phonographs.  However, the official certificate of the Friedensbrücken Kino from 1933 only refers to an optical sound machine. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:17","text":"The second work to be screened by the Association of Friends of the Soviet Union (Bund der Freunde der Sowjetunion) on this communist movie night was only ever available in a silent version. In 1929, when Turksib was released, sound film was already starting to prevail in the USA and increasingly in Europe. However, in the Soviet Union work was underway on several sound film systems in order to avoid being dependent on the Western patents.  The Russian director Viktor Turin had studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood before returning to the Soviet Union and shooting Turksib for the film company Vostok Kino: the film was a documentary about the 898-mile-long railroad line from Turkestan to Siberia, which was constructed from late 1926 to early 1931.  \"In several respects, 'Turksib' is characteristic of the new direction of Russian film art,\" wrote the film critic Fritz Rosenfeld on the day of the Viennese premiere, April 4, 1930, in the Social Democratic Arbeiter-Zeitung, \"it is no longer a feature film; it dispenses with the studio and the actors and nevertheless it is not a documentary film [Kulturfilm] in the usual sense, but rather a dramatically modeled filmic document […].\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Perceptual Gymnastics","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/8?lang=en&info=full#p:18","text":"Turin had presented excerpts from the film in Vienna two months previously at the Society of Engineers and Architects (Ingenieur- und Architektenverein) and emphasized in his introduction that the Soviet directors depicted social conflicts rather than individual heroes. In the case of Turksib, however, the film was not about a communist class war, but the \"development of our country from complete technological backwardness and barbarism to colossal progress,\" as Turin explained in his lecture in Vienna.  This modernization process is embodied by two opposing collectives in the film: while the Russian engineers together with air hammers and mechanical diggers represent the \"colossal progress,\" the \"backwardness and barbarism\" appear in the form of the Kazakh nomads with their donkeys and camels.  However, in Turksib the railroad is not shown as a synthesis of modern and natural life.  Instead, the \"steel path,\" the original title of the film, was intended to liberate the rural territories from the forces of nature. In truth, during the Soviet collectivization of 1931 to 1933, the Kazakhs lost not only their nomadic lifestyle, but some 1.75 million of them also their biological lives. "},{"type":"title","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"Mabuse's Control Center"},{"type":"keywords","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full","text":"cinema optical sound sound-on-disc Klangfilm National Socialism theater organ Tobis Wera Liessem Norbert Jacques Vienna antisemitism 1933 AEG Budapester Orpheum Gesellschaft history of cinema Prater Alfred Deutsch-German Thea von Harbou Blatthaller cinematography Carl Lechner sound technology electronic tube film history Judaism Heinrich Moses Lipsker Siemens & Halske Hermann Stritzko Alfred Hugenberg Hotel Central Gustav Diessl Leopoldstadt Nero Film Fritz Lang Central Kino The Testament of Dr. Mabuse The Jazz Singer Joseph Goebbels UFA Ton Kino Rudolf Klein-Rogge Universum Film AG Oskar Beregi sound film"},{"type":"image","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#i:201","text":"Advertisement for the screening of Fritz Lang's The Testament of Dr.&nbsp;Mabuse in eight movie theaters in Vienna on May&nbsp;13, 1933, printed in Die Stunde (Vienna), May&nbsp;13, 1933, p.&nbsp;1.

The go-between is Mabuse's doctor, Professor Baum (Oskar Beregi), who communicates with the criminal network via telegram and telephone and gives the most important instructions in a kind of control center. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:3","text":"When the associates are summoned to this \"room with the curtain,\" they first have to open two doors with safety locks.

A male voice not only tells those present what they must do but also reacts to their behavior. Those who move are called to order. No one knows what the \"boss\" looks like, and no one would dare to peer behind the curtain since a colleague was killed for doing just that. The secret is only aired when a rogue associate, Kent (Gustav Diessl), is locked in the room with his lover, Lilli (Wera Liessem). He shoots at the curtain, rips it aside, and discovers a table with a microphone and loudspeaker behind which a dummy is affixed.  The couple escape a ticking time bomb thanks to Kent piercing the pipe that leads to the removed urinal with a knife and a revolver and filling the room with water until the pressure breaks a hole in the wooden floor."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:4","text":"In the specialist literature, readers' attention is often drawn to the similarities between Mabuse's control center and the movie theater.  What Kent and Lilli discover is in principle the equipment for screening sound films. However, Lang appears to be intentionally trying to disorient the audience in this sequence, because the angle of the shots alternates axially between the curtain and the door, or, to continue the analogy, between the screen and the seats. The dummy's shadow is cast onto the curtain like the film's images onto a screen. But at the point of the reveal, it seems as though Kent and Lilli were breaking the fourth wall and looking straight at the audience.  Furthermore, not only is there a loudspeaker on the table, but also a microphone to transmit or record sounds. It is certainly striking that the sound film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse reflects its use of audiovisual technology.  Hence, the fictional control center alludes to the type of cinema that was becoming established internationally around 1930."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:5","text":"The development from theater to cinema can be demonstrated by the UFA Ton Kino at Taborstrasse 8, for example,  which was one of the locations for the Vienna premiere of The Testament of Dr. Mabuse and screened the film at 4:45, 7:00, and 9:10 p.m. that weekend, May 13 and 14, 1933.  The cinema had opened as the Central Kino on the ground floor of Hotel Central in 1916, where a theater had been installed around 1900, which was also available to rent for events by associations and individuals.  A theatrical ensemble founded in 1889 that had previously performed in the building opposite, the Hotel Zum Schwarzen Adler at Taborstrasse 11, the Budapester Orpheum Society (Budapester Orpheum Gesellschaft) played the \"musical comedy hall\" at the Central from summer 1903. \"In front of what was mostly a full house, a four-hour program was offered every day until the outbreak of war in 1914,\" writes Georg Wacks of the Budapester Orpheum: \"The program comprised solo cabaret recitals, performances by various comedians, musical interludes by Viennese folk and operetta singers, dance performances, and guest appearances by nonresident artistes.\"  Loved for its Jargon theater, the ensemble combined Viennese and Jewish dialects into the \"Jiddeln\" that was an everyday language in the Leopoldstadt, Vienna's second district through which the Taborstrasse runs. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:6","text":"The auditorium at Hotel Central was licensed for 540 people.  In front of the stage was the orchestra, followed first by reserved and then free seats.

The apparatus could photograph and project sixteen frames per second, which the human eye only just recognizes as flowing movement.  In the years that followed, cinematography became a permanent attraction in Vienna's Prater and in variety shows. Around the time when cinematographic recordings were also being shown at Hotel Central, the first permanent movie theaters became established in the city: by 1906 there were already seventeen cinemas in Vienna.  That might have been one reason why the Budapester Orpheum only screened films for one year before returning to concentrate on its core business, Jewish cabaret shows.  Finally, in 1913 the ensemble moved to its own theater built a five-minute walk away at Praterstrasse 25. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:8","text":"During World War I, the Committee of Daycare Centers for War Orphans and Needy Children of Enlisted Persons (Komitee der Tagesheimstätten für Krieger-Waisen und bedürftige Kinder von Eingerückten) made an application to the police headquarters in Vienna for permission to open a movie theater in the auditorium of Hotel Central.  For this purpose, the stage had to be bricked up and a waiting room for the audience as well as a projection room for the film projector had to be built.

These technical difficulties could be remedied after World War I when the electronic tube amplifiers first patented by Robert von Lieben (1906) and Lee de Forest (1907) were used.  Though not uncontested in specialist literature, the breakthrough for sound film is generally considered to be The Jazz Singer, which premiered in New York in 1927 and which Warner Brothers had produced using their sound-on-disc technique called Vitaphone.  What was novel about Alan Crosland's motion picture about a New York singer and son of a Jewish cantor who rises from the ghetto on the Lower East Side to become a musical star on Broadway was not only the musical interludes integrated in the plot, but above all a short monologue by the leading actor Al Jolson and a dialogue between him and his on-screen mother. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:11","text":"The Jazz Singer premiered in Austria on January 21, 1929, namely at the Central Kino at Taborstrasse 8 in Vienna.  However, what was shown was neither the American original nor a post-dubbed German version, but rather a silent version with intertitles, which was accompanied by music from the cinema orchestra, as well as singers and records.  \"A swindle,\" declared Das Kleine Blatt:"},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:12","text":"Instead of the greatly hyped sound feature, one is shown mouths opened in silence followed by overabundant inserted text.

The cofounder and future president of the German National People's Party had taken over UFA in 1927, which was in dire financial straits, partly because of Fritz Lang's film Metropolis whose production had cost over five million reichsmarks.  In the course of its financial recovery, the experiments with optical sound were abandoned, which had been conducted by the company in collaboration with the Tri-Ergon group of inventors since the mid-1920s.  After the founding of the German Tonbild Syndikat AG, known as Tobis for short, and Klangfilm GmbH, which signed a cooperation agreement in March 1929, UFA concluded the aforementioned contract with Klangfilm, which is probably what led to the sound film equipment being fitted in Vienna's Central Kino. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:15","text":"The \"schematic of the Klangfilm equipment at the Central Kino\" has been preserved in the Municipal and Provincial Archives of Vienna.  The two apparatuses it shows each comprise a motion-picture and a sound projector, as well as a phonograph, which were powered by an electric motor, meaning that 35 mm films could be screened silently, with optical sound, or with records being played synchronously at a constant speed of twenty-four frames per second.  For the sound reinforcement system in the auditorium, which was now licensed to hold 1,048 people, two \"Blatthaller\" were deployed, presumably positioned to the left and right of the screen.  The Blatthaller was an electrodynamic loudspeaker by Siemens & Halske, which was available in a range of versions around 1930.  According to the AEG schematic from 1929, the 20 cm wide and 54 cm tall, that is, the smaller model of the loudspeaker was used in the Central Kino,  which allowed the sound direction to be steered more easily than the bigger \"Riesenblatthaller.\"  Nevertheless, the acoustics still appear to have caused problems, because the following year the interior of the UFA Ton Kino was clad in fabric to improve the sound quality. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"At first, most sound features were released in both an optical sound and a sound-on-disc version.  However, it did not take long for the optical sound method to become prevalent, the product of which, a soundtrack recorded on film, was easier to cut and combine with the images than the records.  As such, Fritz Lang's The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was also filmed using the Tobis-Klangfilm system in 1932 before being distributed in early 1933 as an optical sound film in 35 mm format.  On the same day that the feature film was banned in Germany, March 29, 1933, the board of UFA decided to terminate all employment contracts with Jewish employees.  A government under the leadership of Adolf Hitler had been in office in the German Reich for just two months; not only was Alfred Hugenberg part of this administration as its economy minister, but now also Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who had personally demanded that The Testament of Dr. Mabuse be banned. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mabuse's Control Center","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/9?lang=en&info=full#p:17","text":"Shortly before the film's premiere at the UFA Ton Kino in Vienna, there was a change of management.

Goethe, who was only in his early twenties at the time and had just started working as a lawyer in Frankfurt am Main, based his literary portrayal on the Lebens-Beschreibung Herrn Gözens von Berlichingen, the autobiography published in 1731 by a Franconian imperial knight of the Holy Roman Empire who lived at the end of the late Middle Ages and the beginning of the early modern period.  Despite having lost his right hand as a young man and needing to wear a prosthesis, this Gottfried von Berlichingen grew into a notorious mercenary who earned his money primarily with chivalric feuds.  In other words, he was paid by private citizens or families to wage war against their enemies. However, Goethe portrayed the historical military entrepreneur as a German freedom fighter, \"whom the princes hate, and to whom the oppressed turn.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:7","text":"In one of the twenty-one scenes of the third act, Götz entrenches himself with his family in Jagsthausen Castle.  As Emperor Maximilian I has imposed the imperial ban (Reichsacht) on him, i.e., declared Berlichingen an outlaw for breaching the peace, the imperial army lays siege to his castle. When a messenger calls on him to surrender, Götz shouts out of the window: \"Tell your captain: For His Imperial Majesty I have as ever due respect. But he, tell him, he can lick me in the ass.\"  The scene ends with the stage direction: \"(slams the window shut.)\"  As an imperial knight of the Holy Roman Empire, Berlichingen is under the direct control of the emperor and, in contrast to his childhood friend and now rival Adelbert von Weislingen, does not serve a territorial prince. He feels personally beholden to Maximilian I but insists on the traditional right of knights to fight feuds. As Götz does not recognize the Roman law according to which the emperor has sentenced him, he considers himself innocent. That means that the Götz quote corresponds in the original text to the meaning of the expression \"protection and defiance\" (Schutz und Trutz), because Berlichingen is not only attempting to protect his territory from invaders, to make his enemy retreat, but also expressing—in a provocative and humiliating way—his defiance, his resistance to authority, through his jeer that his foe should lick him in the ass."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:8","text":"In this passage, Goethe further specified the description in the memoirs of the historical Götz von Berlichingen, who had apparently told a senior civil servant, \"he should lick my behind.\"  However, the explicit version in the play is already the verbalization of an action that dates back much further than the Middle Ages. In the mid-nineteenth century, the archaeologist Otto Jahn investigated the superstition that can be found primarily in Greece and Italy since antiquity, according to which envy can have a deleterious effect, which is wielded via the \"evil eye.\"  According to Jahn, the obscene and offensive exposure of the genitalia was one of the ways to hinder or fend off envious gazes.  Showing one's buttocks as a defensive gesture can also be found in German folk legends, where it is used on the one hand against ghosts or thunderstorms and on the other against besiegers.  In these functions, so-called \"mooners\" (Blecker) also appear on castles, churches, city gates, and patrician houses in wooden  or stone  form, always facing outward.  While in the profane realm the apotropaic effect of the naked posterior, i.e., its ability to avert evil or bad luck, was at the fore, such grotesque figures inside churches were also depicted as counterpoints to Christian authorities,  as representatives of the apostate people of god. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"Whether the mooners were intended to have more of a protective or lampooning effect is not always clear in every case. The second effect presupposes a hierarchical relationship because an exposed behind is generally aimed at religious or political elders and betters. This kind of insult as a specific act is recorded in Vienna in the late Middle Ages, where according to the chronicler Michael Beheim some Viennese residents showed their naked buttocks to Empress Eleonore and her female entourage in 1462 and shouted to them: \"Thou empress and ye virgins! / This mirror ye should merge in!\"  That not only the act but also the linguistic taunt to lick someone on or in the ass is to be understood as an \"expression of defiance\" was emphasized by Sigmund Freud in reference to Goethe's Götz von Berlichingen. The founder of psychoanalysis regarded obstinacy—together with orderliness and parsimony—as the result of the sublimation of anal erotism. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:10","text":"Howsoever these psychological connections may develop, it is a fact that the Götz quote expresses in both the gestural and linguistic version a historically established pattern of behavior. Just as Goethe incorporated a figure of speech that was common in southern Germany in his literature, the inhabitants of the Lassalle Hof did not invent the corresponding defiant gesture but simply used it at an appropriate moment. What is additionally remarkable is that in both cases the medieval context of the mooners is brought to mind. In the play, the similarity is obvious: the knight Götz von Berlichingen shouts the expletive from a window of his Jagsthausen Castle during its siege. In contrast, at the protest in Vienna on May 13, 1933, this analogy requires further explanation."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:11","text":"The municipality of Vienna invited submissions for the construction of the apartment building named after Ferdinand Lassalle, a pioneer of the German labor movement, in fall 1923.  As it was in a prominent position in terms of urban planning, the future building should \"be particularly exemplary.\"  What was realized from May 1924, however, was not the winning project by the architect Karl Krist, but the second-place design for a \"Lassalle tower\" by Hubert Gessner's office. Like many of the 199 architects who were commissioned with building the 382 public housing projects (Gemeindebauten) in Vienna from 1919 to 1934, Gessner had studied under Otto Wagner at the Academy of Fine Arts.  He was supported by Victor Adler, the founder of the Social Democratic Workers' Party in Austria, and planned among many other buildings the Arbeiterheim Favoriten workers' house (1902) and the business premises of the party's Vorwärts publishing house (1910), which also incorporated the editorial department of the Social Democratic Arbeiter-Zeitung. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:12","text":"Gessner's construction style, which became characteristic of public housing in Vienna, was strongly influenced by Wagner's urban planning, which favored multistory apartment buildings with green courtyards over settlements with row houses.  Wagner's students had learned how to deal with large building volumes and insert the new apartment buildings into the former imperial seat in a conservative rather than radical way.  Therefore, public housing not only differs from concepts of the settlement movement (Siedlerbewegung), which were advocated in Vienna by the likes of the architect Adolf Loos, but also from the functional approach of the International Style, which in Germany found expression at the Bauhaus.  These differences go beyond the buildings' external appearance, because to create work for as many people as possible, the communal housing complexes in Vienna were intentionally built using conventional construction techniques.  The apartments, all of which were equipped with toilets and gas ovens and were almost free for Viennese working-class families, were a considerable improvement compared to the overpriced nineteenth-century tenements, where water access and toilets were located in the hallways.  When compared with the Modernist furnished model settlements in Frankfurt am Main and Berlin, Vienna's public housing seemed modest. Yet the aim of the Social Democratic city government or rather \"Red Vienna\" as a whole to improve living conditions for as many workers as possible with the funding available was certainly achieved with the new apartment blocks they built. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:13","text":"In his speech at the opening of the Lassalle Hof on October 3, 1926, Vienna's mayor Karl Seitz emphasized that it was impossible to provide every working-class family with their own house in a city.  Even the 290 apartments in this new municipal housing project were neither \"showy\" nor \"excessively large,\" but they went some way toward reducing the \"housing shortage,\" and therefore the city government would abide by this tried-and-tested concept and continue to build multistory apartment complexes with communal facilities like kindergartens and libraries.  In the brochure to accompany the opening, the municipal planning and building office highlighted the position of the building site, which \"from an urban planning perspective\" had required \"a particular emphasis of the architectural structure,\" which the now realized project had achieved with a \"tower-like development of the corner of the building.\"  The eight-story tower facing Lassallestrasse with bay windows and a top-mounted glass pavilion marks \"a threshold for those who approach the city from the Reichsbrücke or those who leave it after having come from Praterstern.\"  In the specialist literature, the Lassalle Hof is also described as a \"bridgehead\" to the Danube and as the \"entrance gate to the city.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:14","text":"For the Viennese architect Josef Frank, a vehement supporter of the settlement movement, this mixture of lower-middle-class apartments and monumental façades was fittingly expressed in the term \"people's apartment palace.\"  Instead of aiming to provide every working-class family with a house with garden, Vienna's public housing was competing with the pathos of princely residences.  As one could not directly draw on monarchical architecture as a republican, however, the \"primitive-thinking planners\" reverted \"to medieval forms\": \"castle doors, towers, bay windows, and battlements that in former times were the accessories of the ideal dwelling of the petit bourgeois, who looked to German history for inspiration.\"  Indeed, the Lassalle Hof with its mighty tower and massive portal, its bay windows and battlements, is reminiscent of a medieval castle in whose windows at around 3:30 p.m. on May 13, 1933, a row of mooners appeared. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:15","text":"With their naked buttocks, these (presumably Social Democratic- or Communist-minded) inhabitants of the Viennese public housing project wanted to offend their political opponents from Germany and deny the arriving National Socialists the authority that their supporters at the edge of the road were jubilantly asserting.  However, due to the location and architecture of the Lassalle Hof, it was also a gesture of defiance aimed at invaders or besiegers: the Nazi politicians who were coming to Vienna to advocate Austria's annexation by the German Reich were supposed to be scared off and prevented from passing into the city. Yet Hans Frank drove on to the Adolf Hitler House, albeit diverted into side streets by the police at Praterstern, then went on stage that evening at the Engelmann Arena, gave a press conference the following day in the German embassy, and was only expelled from Austria on Monday, May 15, 1933, by order of the federal government. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Lick Me in the Ass!\"","location":"/topology/mediations/2/mediators/10?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"In order to interpret this gesture of protest appropriately, its body language must be understood.

In his studies on the French author François Rabelais, the Russian literary scholar Mikhail Bakhtin pointed out that while the eyes are of crucial significance to the body's individuality in the modern period, the grotesque body of the Renaissance emphasized its \"convexities and orifices,\" above all the mouth and the nose, the phallus and the buttocks.  In this sense, the Viennese mooners of May 13, 1933, not only called into question the authority of the German Nazi politicians, but also \"the individual, strictly limited mass, the impenetrable façade\" of the modern body. "},{"type":"title","title":"Mikes, Cables, Transmitters","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/11?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"Mikes, Cables, Transmitters"},{"type":"keywords","title":"Mikes, Cables, Transmitters","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/11?lang=en&info=full","text":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg Emil Fey recording van Schönbrunn Selenophon optical sound Engelbert Dollfuss Radio Verkehrs AG Austrofascism National Socialism Radio Wien RAVAG Austria AEG 1933 Vienna Blatthaller Siemens & Halske Fascism Fox Movietone News broadcasting van carbon microphone live broadcast Rosenhügel Reisz microphone Oskar Czeija shortwave radio history Telefunken mushroom loudspeaker dynamic microphone moving-coil microphone public-address system loudspeaker microphone Turks Deliverance Celebration Eugen Reisz Western Electric cabel mass rally radio technology Czeija Nissl & Co record transmitter Bisamberg transmission"},{"type":"image","title":"Mikes, Cables, Transmitters","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/11?lang=en&info=full#i:92","text":"Engelbert Dollfuss (in front of the microphones) and Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg (behind him) on the garden terrace of Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna at the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" (Türkenbefreiungsfeier) on May&nbsp;14, 1933.

In the RAVAG's recording van, which was set up in the early 1930s and was somewhat erroneously called \"transmitter car\" (Übertragerauto),  it was not only possible to record the original sound on wax and gelatin records;  it was also furnished with Selenophon's professional U7 tape recorder,  which could record and play optical sound on celluloid or paper film.  After development, the six-millimeter-wide film—in contrast to records—could be cut and stuck back together at will, i.e., edited as in the process of film production.

In the marble block of the Reisz microphone, there was a hole filled with carbon granules, over which there lay a rubber membrane.  Electricity was transmitted through the granules via electrodes, with the resistance changing due to speech hitting the membrane.

However, the shortwave broadcaster car was used from 11:05 a.m., i.e., immediately after the broadcast of the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration,\" for a live report on a relay race  and photographed doing so on the race track in the Prater park.  As Schönbrunn is in the southwest of Vienna but the Prater in the northeast, the OB van cannot have been used in both places as there was simply not enough time for it to travel from one location to the other."},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mikes, Cables, Transmitters","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/11?lang=en&info=full#p:13","text":"Perhaps one of the transportable shortwave transmitters, which were also in operation at the RAVAG from 1929, was used to broadcast the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration.\"  However, it is more probable that the live broadcast was simply transmitted via telephone cable from Schönbrunn Palace to Johannesgasse 4 in Vienna's first district, where the broadcasting center had been located since 1926.  In the two years prior to this, Radio Wien had been housed on the top floor of the army ministry on Stubenring. Initially the RAVAG also broadcast from there before erecting a radio transmitter by Telefunken on the Rosenhügel, a hill in the southwest of Vienna, in 1925  whose capacity was increased from seven to fifteen kilowatts in 1927.  Between the studios on Johannesgasse and the large transmitter on the Rosenhügel, an almost ten-kilometer radio cable produced by Siemens was laid  that permitted transmissions without distortion at a frequency of up to 10,000 hertz, which covers the most important range of the human auditory field for speech and music. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Mikes, Cables, Transmitters","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/11?lang=en&info=full#p:14","text":"On May 28, 1933, two weeks after the rally in Schönbrunn, the RAVAG's new large transmitter with a 130-meter radio mast was officially put into operation on the Bisamberg in the north of Vienna.  Again by Telefunken, this system had a transmitting capacity of one hundred kilowatts and had been in trial operation since early May.  Due to Austria's elongated, partly mountainous terrain, even this transmitter was not capable of sending its radio waves to all parts of the country at the strength required for radio reception, and much less its predecessor on the Rosenhügel, which probably transmitted the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration.\" For that reason, since the mid-1920s radio cables had been laid from the capital city in the far east to the west and south of Austria and several relay stations had been built.  That means that the alternating currents in this specific case, the live broadcast from 10:20 to 11:05 a.m. on May 14, 1933, were not only relayed by radio cable to the Rosenhügel after presumably arriving at the RAVAG headquarters via telephone connection from Schönbrunn Palace, but also to the regional transmitters in Graz, Linz, Klagenfurt, Salzburg, and Innsbruck, which produced electromagnetic waves at the respectively assigned frequency or length and broadcast it in the provinces.  To the chagrin of the residents of Vorarlberg, the westernmost part of Austria, who had complained about the poor reception of Radio Wien for a decade, the transmitter in Lauterach was only completed in late 1934. "},{"type":"title","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"RAVAG Studies"},{"type":"keywords","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full","text":"McCann-Erickson survey Austro-Marxism Ernest Dichter Schönbrunn social physics focus group opinion research Marie Jahoda Columbia University communication research RAVAG study propaganda Engelbert Dollfuss Austrofascism statistics Radio Verkehrs AG Paul Felix Lazarsfeld audience survey RAVAG Radio Wien Vienna 1933 Wirtschaftspsychologische Forschungsstelle target group Austria Red Vienna Robert Lynd live broadcast Oskar Czeija radio history Turks Deliverance Celebration 1683 Turkish siege economic psychology University of Vienna psychology program analyzer Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal listener types Rockefeller Foundation market research Bureau of Applied Social Research motivation research Princeton Radio Project social psychology Herta Herzog Charlotte Bühler questionnaire Otto Bauer listener survey New York average man Karl Bühler sociology Hans Zeisel experiment"},{"type":"image","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#i:250","text":"Organization chart of the Austrian Radio Verkehrs&nbsp;AG (RAVAG) founded in 1924, printed in Viktor Ergert: 50&nbsp;Jahre Rundfunk in Österreich.

Dollfuss had already declared on Radio Wien on March 13 that there was not a national crisis but a parliamentary crisis, and his government was implementing ongoing resolutions via emergency decree until a new constitution organized around professions had been finalized.  Subsequently, the members of the federal government were regularly given the chance to speak on Radio Wien.  From April the national anthem was played at the end of each day's broadcasts, and the first program in the series \"Homeland Hour\" (Stunde der Heimat) on May 16—two days after the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\"—was dedicated to the topic \"1683 in the fate of Austria and Germany.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:6","text":"General Manager Czeija and his employees submitted to this authoritarian course and designed a program of radio shows from spring 1933 that met the federal government's demands but in large part flew in the face of public wishes. In actual fact, the majority of listeners wanted to be neither intellectually nor politically educated by the radio, but rather above all to be entertained by it. As early as December 1924, three months after the RAVAG had started broadcasting, the Vienna Radiowelt asked its readers: \"What do you want to hear?\" and summarized the results of the survey in keywords in May 1925: \"No politics, no stock market, no sermon!\"  Three years later Franz Anderle, the editor of this radio magazine, wrote a leading article in which he called on the Viennese broadcaster to have a statistical study conducted of the wishes and composition of its audience. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:7","text":"In 1931 the RAVAG finally responded to the challenge—posed not only by Radiowelt—to investigate their listeners' likes and dislikes with a series of surveys conducted in cooperation with the Department of Psychology at the University of Vienna. It started with a musical request program with almost 50,000 votes cast, which revealed that Johann Strauss was the most popular composer and his waltz The Blue Danube the most requested piece.  This was followed by an experiment whereby listeners had to guess the appearance and profession of nine men, women, and adolescents whose voices were broadcast over the radio.  Another survey, which focused on the reasons for canceling RAVAG licenses, came to the conclusion that almost half of the former listeners were obliged to do so for financial reasons.  When one considers that a factory worker in Vienna earned approximately sixty schillings a week at the time, the monthly radio license fee of two schillings may seem affordable. However, the simple crystal receivers with headphones from the first years of radio were followed by tube sets,  which had already become established around 1930 and whose entry-level models complete with accessories cost some hundred schillings. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:8","text":"The series of studies culminated in a large-scale listener survey whose questionnaire was enclosed in radio magazines and displayed in tobacco shops in November 1931 and had to be returned to the RAVAG headquarters at Johannesgasse 4 in Vienna by December 1.  The scientific management of the project was once again taken over by the Department of Psychology at the University of Vienna, which was opened in 1922 and whose chair was held by Karl Bühler, who had doctorates in medicine and philosophy. At the department there were three research teams: experimental psychology run by Egon Brunswik; child and adolescent psychology by Bühler's wife Charlotte, who was appointed associate professor in 1929; and economic psychology, which was also responsible for the RAVAG studies. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"After a start-up period, the latter group was officially founded by Paul Lazarsfeld as the Center of Economic-Psychological Research (Wirtschaftspsychologische Forchungsstelle) in 1931.  Lazarsfeld had a doctorate in mathematics and applied his statistical skills in the late 1920s as an assistant of Charlotte Bühler (though he was not paid from university funds). He was born in Vienna in 1901 and grew up in a Jewish, liberal, Social Democratic household. His father Robert was a lawyer, his mother Sofie a well-known individual psychologist who regularly hosted salons with leading Social Democrats like Friedrich Adler, Otto Bauer, and Rudolf Hilferding.

After all, the prospects of finding employment at the right-wing conservative University of Vienna were slim for liberal-minded, methodically innovative social scientists and humanities scholars, and for Jews it was almost impossible. The research center carried out numerous analyses of sales transactions and product decisions, as well as of movie theater visits and leisure activities in general.  However, its most famous study, initiated by Otto Bauer, the leading theorist of Austrian Social Democracy, addressed a sociopolitical problem: the severe unemployment in Marienthal in Lower Austria, which was analyzed in 1931/32 using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods and according to the study's own results brought the village to not only an economic but also a psychological standstill. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:11","text":"Published in 1933 and largely compiled by Marie Jahoda, the study report Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal contains an appendix on the \"history of sociography,\" which was written by Hans Zeisel, a lifelong friend of Lazarsfeld who had a doctorate in law.  This essay traces the development of scientific methods for compiling data about populations, going back to the early modern period. Zeisel explains the emergence of \"political arithmetic\" in seventeenth-century England with the demise of the medieval social order and the growing possibilities for people and things to move more freely across territories. In an essay on the same topic published some three decades later, Lazarsfeld contrasts the British studies by John Graunt and William Petty, which he also associates with the emerging insurance industry, with the German statistics in terms of a comparative theory of the state, which was greatly influenced by Gottfried Achenwall in Göttingen in the eighteenth century. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:12","text":"For the nineteenth century the historical perspectives of the texts by Zeisel and Lazarsfeld correspond, according to which the crucial progress in empirical social research resulted from Adolphe Quetelet and Frédéric Le Play. While the Belgian Quetelet attempted with his \"social physics\" and \"moral statistics\" to identify patterns in human behavior and define an \"average man\" on the basis of probability calculations, the French Le Play developed new methods to compile social data with his \"family monographs.\" Furthermore, Zeisel cites the lifestyle analyses of Max Weber and the Middletown study by Robert and Helen Lynd published in 1929 as being sociographically exemplary. Contemporary American social and market research with its clipping bureaus to collect newspaper cutouts and its standardized questionnaires, however, threatened to deteriorate into \"survey machinery\" amassing endless data.

After all, the form distributed in the radio magazines and tobacco shops entitled \"What do you want to hear?\" contained not only questions on fifty-four program categories, which were to be answered with \"more (+), less (–), or the same amount (=),\" but also on the listeners' place of residence, age, gender, and occupation. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:14","text":"How welcome this survey was is expressed by the remarkable response rate: although there was not much time to answer the questions and postage had to be paid by the respondents themselves, the RAVAG received some 36,000 completed questionnaires, which had been filled out by slightly over three people on average. That means that almost every tenth of the 400,000 Austrian households who had a registered radio in late 1931 had taken part in the survey.  Statistically structuring the audience according to profession was already commonplace in Germany around 1930.  However, the RAVAG study's final report written in 1932 divided the 110,312 listeners who had recorded their wishes on the questionnaires not only into different social classes, but also correlated these listener types with program categories.  In other words, the statistical analysis by the Center of Economic-Psychological Research created specific target groups."},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:15","text":"The hundreds of thousands of opinions expressed in the questionnaires had to be entered into tables by hand and analyzed using thousands of calculations.

For example, the calculated figure for topical scientific lectures among men living in Vienna amounted to +17, but among women from the provinces –11. Whereas the workers wanted to hear jazz more often on the radio (+28), this controversial genre was rejected in intellectual circles (–19).  The statistical analyses also showed that workers' spiritual interests increased with age, while the opposite trend was true for the bourgeoisie."},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"Overall, the most popular programs included variety shows (+67) and comedies (+45), with chamber music (–66) and literary readings (–47), for example, being strongly disliked.

One frequently expressed request was evidently to broadcast the entertainment programs before 10 p.m. in the evening and on the weekend, with a tailor from the Mühlviertel in Upper Austria even sending in a complete week's program—adapted to his daily routine—to illustrate this wish. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:17","text":"The complete study report on the listener survey was only published in 1996, after the fifty-two-page typescript had been discovered in Lazarsfeld's papers.  Nevertheless, a four-page article summarizing the results was published in the magazine Radio Wien in early November 1932.  The unnamed author assured readers toward the end of the text that the survey would have an impact on programing. For example, Radio Wien would be broadcasting more entertainment shows in the early evening, as desired by the majority of listeners. \"Yet it must not be forgotten,\" the article continues, \"that alongside entertainment and distraction, radio must also offer instruction and improvement in order to merit its cultural significance.\" Radio was capable of \"increasingly raising the level of education of the broadest swathes\" and it was down to the public not to listen \"indiscriminately,\" but to follow certain programs with the necessary \"concentration.\"  Such admonitions were entirely in accordance with the RAVAG's self-understanding as a public service broadcaster, which conceived of its program in terms of a wireless adult education center. From 1933, however, this mission to educate the people was put to the service of propaganda by dictatorial regimes in Austria and Germany alike. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:18","text":"That the RAVAG study from 1931/32 nevertheless had an impact is related to Paul Lazarsfeld's career path.  In his memoirs he emphasized that his interest in social classes had ideological roots.  In line with Austro-Marxism, the Austrian school of Marxist thought, the young social psychologist interpreted consumer and leisure behavior as part of political life: what, for example, characterized the proletarian lifestyle in Vienna around 1930? Moreover, he attempted to analyze decision-making processes to influence elections in favor of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. \"Such is the origin of my Vienna market research studies,\" wrote Lazarsfeld retrospectively, \"the result of the methodological equivalence of socialist voting and the buying of soap.\"  In September 1933 he traveled to New York on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study the American methods of social and market research.  His original plan was to return to Austria and apply his newly gained knowledge for the Center of Economic-Psychological Research. However, due to the political upheavals in Europe and the appreciably better career prospects in the USA, Lazarsfeld decided in 1935 to remain in New York, where he went on to become one of the most influential sociologists and communication researchers of the twentieth century. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:19","text":"In a lecture in Salzburg in 1974, the by then emeritus professor of sociology at Columbia University said that the early survey of Austrian radio listeners became the foundation of \"what was for many years the main feature of American audience research.\"  In 1937 Lazarsfeld, at the recommendation of Robert Lynd, the author of the sociological study Middletown (1929), was appointed the head of an extensive research project on radio use in the USA, which was officially connected with Princeton University but was initially carried out in Newark in New Jersey and from 1939 to 1944 at Columbia University in New York.  Also involved in this project, which was largely financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, were a number of his colleagues from the Center of Economic-Psychological Research who had had to flee from Austria due to their political convictions or Jewish heritage, including Marie Jahoda, Hans Zeisel, Ernest Dichter, who would later become a famous motivation researcher, and Lazarsfeld's second wife Herta Herzog, who had completed a doctoral thesis under Karl Bühler in Vienna in 1932 on the aforementioned RAVAG experiment on voice recognition on the radio. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:20","text":"At first the research group did principally the same as they had done in Austria, namely evaluating statistics on the radio audience's programming requests and social data in such a way that different types of listeners emerged. However, the main difference lay in the fact that in the USA these statistical analyses could be exploited for financial gain and were therefore in high demand.  While Austria and Germany—like most European states—organized radio stations as public service broadcasters, the American radio stations were commercial enterprises from the outset and were not funded by licenses but by advertising.  In the USA in the early 1930s, some seventeen million radio sets received the transmissions of over 600 radio stations.  In order to use this new mass medium for targeted advertising, programs had to be sold on the stations and at the times that reached as many of the desired consumers as possible. This division of the radio audience into different target groups was a financially valuable research achievement by the Office of Radio Research. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"RAVAG Studies","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/12?lang=en&info=full#p:21","text":"However, the group of researchers did not limit themselves to statistical analyses but also conducted laboratory experiments.  Back in Vienna Lazarsfeld had already had the idea to test the plus/minus evaluation of radio programs used for the RAVAG study in experiments. In collaboration with Frank Stanton, who ran the research department of Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and was the codirector of the Office of Radio Research, Lazarsfeld now developed this concept into the so-called \"program analyzer\" in 1937/38, which was used primarily in the 1940s.  It was a polygraph to synchronously measure the program reactions of selected listeners. The test subjects sat together in a radio studio and listened to a certain radio program, which they could rate with a green (+) or a red (–) button.  These reactions were recorded on a roll of paper as deviations upward (+) or downward (–).

To interpret the results, the experiment was followed by lengthy group interviews in which the test subjects were asked to explain their spontaneous reactions to the program. Lazarsfeld's colleague from Columbia University, the sociologist Robert K. Merton, made the technique famous as the \"focused interview\" and later as the \"focus group.\"  However, it has since been proven that this method was actually developed by Herta Herzog, who alongside Ernest Dichter became the most important advocate of the \"Vienna school of motivation research\" in American marketing. "},{"type":"title","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:0","text":"\"Torches of Freedom\""},{"type":"keywords","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full","text":"Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg McCann-Erickson survey Ernest Dichter Columbia University Statue of Liberty lifestyle American Tobacco Company publicity smoking bacon desire depth psychology emancipation Walter Lippmann stereotype freedom opinion leader pseudo-event social research Lucky Strike propaganda Beech-Nut Packing Company Austrofascism Paul Felix Lazarsfeld American breakfast target group dramatization motive Wirtschaftspsychologische Forschungsstelle Vienna 1933 Austria public opinion interview Easter parade public sphere need torches of freedom psychoanalysis PR Turks Deliverance Celebration 1683 Neue Freie Presse Turkish siege psychology Karl Bühler Rockefeller Foundation market research Bureau of Applied Social Research motivation research Princeton Radio Project Herta Herzog Charlotte Bühler advertising Sigmund Freud New York USA Edward Bernays marketing P.T.

Bernays,\" who had developed \"indirect advertising\" in the style of the circus pioneer and businessman P.T. Barnum into a scientific service.  The New York-based counsel on public relations, as Bernays himself described his profession, may have seemed particularly interesting to the Neue Freie Presse because he was related to Sigmund Freud. \"The uncle in Vienna reveals the subconscious in the individual's instinctual life; the American nephew analyzes the unsatisfied desires of the masses,\" the article's author Arthur Rundt says of the familial and intellectual connection between the founder of psychoanalysis and this \"expert in public opinion.\" "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:3","text":"Presumably, it was a coincidence that the publication of the article entitled \"Humbug, Bluff, and Ballyhoo\" coincided with the \"Turks Deliverance Celebration.\" Although the Neue Freie Presse took a rather critical stance on the rally of the Home Guards (Heimwehren) in Schönbrunn in the leading article,  it is unlikely that an association with the advertising techniques of Edward Bernays was intended. It is equally unlikely that Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the federal leader of the Austrian Homeland Protection and the initiator of the event, was familiar with the books and campaigns by the American PR counsel. Nevertheless, parallels can be observed. After all, Starhemberg had the anniversary of Vienna's liberation from the Ottoman siege in summer 1683 marked on May 14, 1933, even though a state \"Turks Deliverance Celebration\" had already been planned for the actual 250th anniversary of the relief on September 12, 1933.  It was a gratuitous event that was intended to cause a public sensation and hence propagate the political idea of Austrofascism.  This idea was communicated through a series of historical stereotypes: of the city of Vienna as a Christian stronghold, of Austrian Germanness, of the threat of barbarism from the East, of aristocratic war heroes."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:4","text":"Both strategies—the creation of pseudo-events and the targeted use of stereotypes—were part of Edward Bernays's PR arsenal.

In the letter he asked whether it was healthier to eat a hearty meal of bacon, eggs, oats, and fruit in the morning or to start the day with coffee and toast.

That means that it was not about advertising a particular article over the competition. Rather, Bernays aimed to create lifestyles that associated behaviors with commodities.  The \"perfect breakfast\" in this sense was truly American, comprising produce from Beech-Nut in Canajoharie, New York, as an advertisement—created around 1930—from the company archive illustrates: the caring wife serves her husband a hearty meal of eggs and bacon in the morning, which not only tastes good, but is also medically recommended for modern daily life in the office. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:9","text":"Another example of this lifestyle marketing is the campaign for the American Tobacco Company that has come to be known as \"torches of freedom.\" From 1928 Bernays was hired by George Washington Hill, the president of the company who wanted to encourage more women to smoke Lucky Strike.  The PR counsel did not follow the cigarette brand's traditional advertising slogan, \"It's toasted,\" which was intended to emphasize that \"Luckies\" tasted especially good and went easy on the throat due to their unique manufacturing process, but rather attempted to position cigarettes as a fashionable accessory. He had special cigarette holders sent to models and photographers, a tactic that was entirely consistent with the new advertising slogan: \"Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet!\"  Smoking reduced feelings of hunger, went the argument, and helped women to look slim and gamine, as was now fashionable. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:10","text":"As part of this campaign, Bernays staged a protest at the Easter parade in New York City on March 31, 1929.

However, the press not only reproduced Bernays's story of the feminists smoking as a symbol of liberty but also pointed out that the parade participants had hardly concerned themselves with them because women smoking in public had long been commonplace.  This means that it was in fact a pseudo-event, which only took place for the media and in the media, with the aim of associating smoking with emancipation in the public consciousness. According to this PR concept, a woman fighting for her freedom no longer had to climb the barricades as Eugène Delacroix had depicted in his famous painting La Liberté guidant le peuple from 1830,  but merely walk confidently down Fifth Avenue—in high heels and a matching hat, with a leather bag under her arm and a \"Lucky\" in her hand.  The cigarette was supposed to be reminiscent of the torch of the Statue of Liberty, erected in New York's harbor in 1886, which embodies the Roman goddess of liberty, though without the revolutionary gesture of the Libertas by Delacroix. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:12","text":"According to his autobiography, the idea of marketing cigarettes as \"torches of freedom\" came to Bernays after a conversation with Abraham Brill, a psychoanalyst who had emigrated from Austria and was now practicing in New York.  That modern propaganda had to understand and influence the subconscious motives of human actions, for example by portraying smoking as an emancipatory act, was highlighted multiple times by Bernays in his writings around 1930.  He referenced the findings of depth psychology and never tired of mentioning his relative Sigmund Freud.  Although Bernays emphasized that public relations had its origin in science, in truth his campaigns were based on intuition and personal relationships. Furthermore, his correspondence with Freud makes clear that his Viennese uncle thought little of his New York nephew's profession.

This kind of survey could not be conducted using standardized forms but only with the aid of psychologically trained interviewers whose skillful and patient conversation techniques were capable of discovering the true motives of purchasing actions.  This concept of motive is also at the heart of the article \"The Psychological Aspect of Market Research,\" which Lazarsfeld published in the Harvard Business Review in 1934. Motives should not be confused with the queried reasons for buying an item but were to be understood as \"concepts of connection\" in the statistical analysis of the collected data.  According to Lazarsfeld, the act of purchasing comprised a complex interplay of internal impulses (e.g., hunger), external influences (e.g., advertising), and attributes of the commodity (e.g., packaging).  Applied economic psychology analyzed this relational structure, which differed from case to case, and advised companies how to find the appropriate advertising means for each product."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:15","text":"In both articles, Lazarsfeld criticized the then common practice in American market research of compiling masses of superficial data and basing their analysis on universal motives. Instead, he advocated the use of qualitative interviews and the development of consumer typologies. Hierarchies of needs were useless in this regard, says a typescript by the Center of Economic-Psychological Research, because people's desires depended on social and cultural circumstances.  After all, the paper argues, a glass of water had a different value in the desert than in the city. To be able to generalize despite this, \"worlds of needs\" had to be formed: \"According to the principle of environmental research, one constructs a world comprising a group of people and a real or spiritual object and attempts to identify the fundamental relationships (and potentially those most responsive to intervention): the vinegar market, the world of the boy, etc.\"  What Lazarsfeld describes in these typescripts written in Vienna around 1930 corresponds to the lifestyle marketing known as public relations that had been practiced by Edward Bernays in New York since the 1920s."},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:16","text":"In contrast to the intuitive approach of the PR counsel, Lazarsfeld and his colleagues created scientific methods to define and be able to influence psychological motives and social target groups. This development started in the Center of Economic-Psychological Research and went via the Princeton Radio Project to the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University, where not only was target group and motivation research conducted, but the concept of opinion leaders applied by Bernays was also empirically proven.  In a study led by Lazarsfeld on the American presidential campaign of 1940, the results of which were published four years later under the title The People's Choice, it was verified by using the panel method, i.e., the repeated questioning of selected individuals, that the impact of media coverage on the population's voting behavior was not direct, but took place via \"opinion leaders.\"  This theory of a two-step flow of communication seriously called into question the notion of omnipotent mass media and conversely emphasized the importance of personal relationships and the activity of the audience. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"\"Torches of Freedom\"","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/13?lang=en&info=full#p:17","text":"Lazarsfeld subsequently concentrated more on the quantitative methods of sociology, but the qualitative tradition of Viennese communication and motivation research was continued by some of his colleagues, above all Herta Herzog and Ernest Dichter, who had previously been active at the Center of Economic-Psychological Research. From 1943 Herzog  worked as a market researcher for the New York advertising agency McCann-Erickson, where she applied in-depth interviews, focus groups, and projective methods like the Rorschach test to create commercial product images.  Dichter  opened his own Institute for Motivational Research in New York in 1946, which also specialized in psychological marketing techniques and was extremely successful in the postwar period.  He marketed products as extensions of people's personalities, supposedly enabling consumers to realize their full potential.

For example, while the large green spaces of the courtyards were deemed \"necessary\" for the communal life of its inhabitants,  the \"necessity\" for the monumental central wing and prestigious cour d'honneur consisted in the propaganda effect on passersby.

In the municipal hospitals, where the vast majority of babies were born, a house call by a female employee of the welfare office was arranged after the birth had been registered, who would then give the mother a package of baby essentials and get an impression of the household.  Furthermore, the mothers were encouraged to visit an advice center to receive guidance from medical specialists regarding feeding and caring for their children.  If the social workers noticed serious issues, especially concerning tidiness and cleanliness in the home, they could apply to the juvenile court to have the child or the children housed in the municipal Child Adoption Center, where a decision would be made about their future care. "},{"type":"mediator","title":"Educating New People","location":"/topology/mediations/3/mediators/14?lang=en&info=full#p:18","text":"Central launderettes as in the Karl Marx Hof were included in all municipal public housing projects with over 300 apartments.  Under the supervision of a \"laundry foreman,\" the female inhabitants could wash, dry, and iron their families' laundry one day a month, partly with the support of appliances.

Via the municipality of Vienna, the Social Democratic Workers' Party had a financial stake in the RAVAG and via various panels it also had influence over staffing and the programming format.  To avoid conflicts, political topics were supposed to seldom if ever appear on Radio Wien and the news programs be kept as neutral as possible.

For this reason, it continued, radio had to be state regulated, but as democratically so as possible.  The same position was taken by the Viennese magazine Radiowelt, which was edited by the officer and radio pioneer Franz Anderle.
